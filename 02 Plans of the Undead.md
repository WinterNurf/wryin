# Plans of the undead

They both headed towards the stables to take their horses. They reached the stables situated at the southers side of the castle. There were thousands of horses in the sheds.

"Take whichever horse you like", said Jake, moving towards a black, shiny horse. "Huh? Ok", replied Norton. Norton took a white horse which has blonde hair on its back. "Norton, lead the path to the graveyard", said Jake. Norton nodded and they both mounted the horses and exited the castle premises.

They rode out in the city streets. "I hope these horses have both speed and stamina or else we won't be able to reach our destination on time", Jake said. "Don't worry, I know these horses. Yours is Bolt, mine is Snowflake. They are on of the best", Norton replied. They rode smoothly out of the busy city, where they took a halt to give their horses some rest and take refreshments.

"It will take us three days to reach the graveyard, according to my calculations, and that too if we move swiftly. We cannot be late", Jake said. Norton answered, "I think we've taken enough rest. Let's move now".

They rode out again, this time into the woods situated northwest outside Drein. Riding very fast here was not possible as huge trees kep obstructing them from time to time. "These clover woods are going to become even denser. We have to move at a slow pace", Norton said. Jake replied, "I can understand. We will be able to reach the Fued River only till tomorrow evening. After that, I suppose that there are only grasslands and a small settlement, Tyrus village. We can replenish our supplies from there. We will surely reach the graveyard day after tomorrow".

They were moving in a slow canter, and so the horses were not getting tired. Till evening, they had reached the start of the dense part of the woods. At this point, they halted for a long rest. The horses, now full of sweat, started rolling in the mud and grazing on the green grass there. Norton and Jake sat under a tree and started making further plans.

"From here on, the forest will become very dense. It will take us time to reach the river", Jake said. "I think we could manage trotting all the way, though it'll be quite painful", Norton replied. Jake said, "We have to take some pains, or else no fruit". Norton completely agreed.

After a few hours, Jake said, "I think we should start. We better reach early rather than late". They started off again. Almost instantly, it became dark as the woods suddenly thickened and the moonlight could not enter. Jake lit a fire on two thick and long twigs. Taking these torches, Norton and Jake rode on. They had to turn at every step as the woods were full of trees. At a distance, they saw blood red, thick mist arising out of nowhere, to their left and right.

"What is that?!", Norton asked, frightened. Jake answered, trembling, "I don't kow. Maybe a natural phenomenon". Norton shrugged. As they got very close to the mist, Norton stopped his horse. Jake gave a confused look to Norton. "It is scary". Jake answered, "We have got no other choice". Norton nodded and they bravely rode between the two parts of the mist, but as they reached the middle they noticed that they were now surrounded by the mist. The mist wasn't separate in two parts, but was connected by an arc which ran around in front of them. Now they had no choice but to go through the bloody mist. They could not return back and take a detour as while coming to the place where they were, they had come down from a cliff like structure and now it would be impossible to climb back up.

The horses got frightened and started making funny noises. Jake and Norton patted their horses to calm them down. "Now what should we do?" Norton asked. Jake replied, "We have to be brave and ride on. Come on, it is nothing". They both rode on, trembling even more as the mist was nearing. When they entered the mist, they could see nothing but deep red colour. Finally, they were out, both of the mist and the fear. It had been difficult controlling the horses, but now, ahead of them, they saw a beautiful scene that eased them. The Fued River was flowing in front of them, its water sparkling and the dark woods had finally ended.

"Oh! Finally. The river, and it is just down", Jake said. He and Norton dismounted from their horses and lied down in the cool grass. The horses rushed and started drinking water. After some time, Jake asked, "How are we supposed to cross this river?". They hadn't thought of it, and it seemed to be a major problem. The men patrolled the banks of the river for some time in search of a bridge like structure, but having failed, returned to where the horses were grazing.

Norton suggested, "Maybe we could get the horses to jump across the river". Jake looked at the width of the river and said, "Our horses would not be able to jump such a long distance. We should try further west, where the river is the narrowest". "Yes, but now I think we can afford to take some rest. About an hour or so", Norton said. They both lied down and rested for an hour, while the horses kept on grazing and rolling in the mud. After an hour, they moved on again.

Jake said, "Our path is easy now. We just have to keep moving along the river until it is narrow enough to jump over it". Norton replied, "Yes, but we have to be careful and not deviate from the path". They kept on moving, refreshing themselves with the fresh water of the river from time to time. It did not take them much time, just a few hours to reach a point where the river was quite narrow. It was only afternoon then.

"This place is perfect. Now we have to get our horses to jump over", said Jake. They found a clearing from where the horses could gather some speed before jumping. The men kicked the horses into a gallop, and then, on reaching the river, the horses jumped along with elegance. Norton said, "Ah! Finally. We are across". "Now I think we should take rest for about half an hour. We will take a full rest in Tyrus village. But for that, we will have to reach there till midnight, so we can sleep and also get a full day ahead", Jake said, getting off his horse. "Yawn! I feel sleepy", Norton was getting tired. Jake replied, "You can sleep if you want to. I'll wake you up after some time". Norton acknowledted, "Thank you", and slept. In the meantime, Jake desaddled the horses and gave them a bath.

After about half an hour, Jake woke up Norton. "Wow, the horses look great and energetic", he said. Jake replied, "Yes, just readied them. They need to be refreshed. Our path ahead is long". Norton said, "Now, let's start immediately. Even I'm a litte refreshed". The men mounted the horses and started.

"Wow, this seems so strange. Suddenly, from thick woods, then land has transformed to open grasslands!", Norton exclaimed. Jake said, "Yes, this is what nature is. So diverse. Now we can move faster". He made his horse move to a full gallop and whizzed past Norton. "Hey! Wait for me", Norton shouted, and urged his horse to move forward until he was at Jake's side. "Enjoying the ride?", Jake asked. Norton answered, "Oh! Yes. This is real fun". Even the horses seemed to be enjoying, running around in the vast, open land. Jake warned, "Be careful of lions though. They are common here in the grasslands". Norton said, "Yes, we were lucky enough to get through the woods safely. Now, there is no guarantee that we will get through here". "Don't worry, don't get scared. If we don't harm the wildlife, they won't harm us, you know. Unlike the undead. You have to be really careful with those. Such cruel, ruthless people they are", Jake said. Norton nodded.

After riding for some time, they reached a place with rocky land. It seemed that the grasslands had ended. There were big boulders behind which yellow figures could be seen. Jake and Norton halted. "Mountain lions", Jake whispered, "Move very slowly, without making any noise behind me". The horses moved slowly, without making any noise. The yellow figures were very still. Suddenly, Snowflake snorted. The yellow figures emerged from behind the rocks - mountain lions, and gave chase. Norton was going to make his horse run at full speed, but Jake stopped him by shouting, "Don't move. I'll tell you when we will. Be ready to gallop at full speed".

The lions got nearer, and with every step they took, Jake's and Norton's fear grew. The lions pounced when they had reached quite near. "Move", Jake shouted. The horses shot off in a full gallop, and the lions fell down on the ground behind. "Keep moving", Jake said. "I think we can ride on to Tyrus village now. The horses are also a little frightened, so they will run through. We will reach the village at about ten 'o' clock", Norton answered.

After riding for a long time, they could see settlements in the distance. It was one hour to midnight. "At last, Tyrus village", Jake said. "Would it be nice to disturb the people here at this time?", Norton asked. Jake replied, "I'm very sure we will be able to find an inn". The men rode further on.

The whole of Tyrus village was surrounded by bamboo fencing, with eight gates, made of bamboo, between different part of the fence. The houses were made of bamboo, their roof being of straw. There were light poles, also made of bamboo. They saw a shack made of bamboo, which had a sign board, which read, "Bamboo-Inn".

"That must be the inn. I can also see a stable next to it. A good spot for our horses to rest", said Jake. Norton nodded. They both dismounted their horses and lead them to the stables. After that, they went into the Inn inside which a man was stading behind a small desk made of bamboo. The man instantly smiled on seeing them and said, "Would you like to rest for the night, honoured Sirs?". Norton replied, "Yes, we will need a room". The man said, "The cost will be two gold coins and seven copper coins". Jake answered, "That will be fine with us", handing over some coins to the man, and in return the man handed them their room keys, made of bamboo.

Norton said, "Where's our room? Ahem! This hall is occupying the whole space of the shack". The man replied, "Follow me. I'll take you to your room". The innkeeper walked to the corner of the hall and called out, "Come fast!". Jake and Norton ran towards the innkeeper. The innkeeper opened a trapdoor made of bamboo and went down a bamboo ladder. Norton and Jake followed. They were in a long lobby with many bamboo doors on either side. Jake said, "I think the people of this village are obsessed with bamboo". Norton smiled. The innkeeper lead them to their room which Norton and Jake entered. The room had all bamboo stuff. The air conditioner to the fan, the table lamp to the wall light frame, the bed to the carpet, all was made of bamboo. As they were very sleepy, they went to their bamboo beds and drifted into sleep.

Meanwhile, at the castle in Drein...

In the throne room...

"We spotted a fast moving shadow in the castle", shouted the castle guard. "It was huge", the other guard screamed. "Make everyone alert about the fact though we needn't worry at the moment", said the king, addressing the advisor. "Yes, Your Majesty". The advisor went to the top of the castle and shouted in the loud speaker, "Attention the public of Drein-". A huge creature jumped on to the advisor and slit his throat with his sharp steel-like claws.

In the throne room, "What happened to the announcement?", questioned the king. "Well... go and investigate the matter". A dozen guards replied in chorus, "Yes, Your Majesty", marching out of the throne room. They reached the spot where the king's advisor had died. The guards got scared out of their wits at the sight of the dead body. The king's advisor was so badly murdered that his throat was fully slit open and everything was coming out. He was surrounded by a pool of blood. The huge creature, almost the size of the mass of guards combined, attacked again. In the first strike he killed a guard. "Charge!", shouted the squad leader. The guards took out their swords and dashed towards the huge creature. The swords slashed through the huge creature but it remained unaffected.

The huge creature jumped and landed impaling its claws into two of the guards, instantly killing them. He spun around and dug its claws into the guards in quick succession killing almost all of them. Only one survived who managed to escape from the huge creature's eyes and ran downstairs to the throne room. "Monsterrr! Ugh! Monster", the guard entered the throne room shouting and puffing. The king, in haste, walked towards the frightened guard. He held his shoulders and said, "Be calm. What has happened? Tell me in detail". The guard replied, "The advisor is dead. All the other guards are dead. A huge monster... cough... killed them... cough... all".

"Describe the monster", the king asked. "Umm...", the guard started thinking and said, "It was very huge and scaly, like a reptile. It was about twelve feet tall. It had sharp and long, metal like claws on its massive feet and hands. It had a long snout with numerous sharp canines contained in its jaws. It had long yellow eyes and two slits on its snout, maybe its nostrils. It had spikes on its back and many other parts of its body. It looked terrible... sigh!". "Good work guard, now you need some rest", saying this, the king dismissed the guard.

Atix, the warrior chosen by Jake, who was standing nearby, gave his opinion, "Me and my team will go and confront the creature". The king said, "Good luck my friend, all is in your hands". "Hail Drein! May our kingdom and its people be protected", saying this, Atix moved out of the throne room followed by his team. "Get ready all of you, a battle awaits us. You all heard the guard, the monster seems to be ferocious", Atix said. As soon as the team reached the top of the castle, they spotted the huge creature jump off the top of the castle and land in the courtyard in front of the castle. Sinister, the magician of the team, murmured an incantation and the whole team got teleported to the courtyard right in front of the huge creatue.

"It's an Aquentis! Yes it is!", shouted Lavista. The Aquestis shot some spikes out of its hand at the team but everyone dodged it. Senister created a force field at the perimeter of the courtyard so as to stop the creature from escaping. Atix slashes the creature with his broadsword but it remained unaffected. "Wah! It's invulnerable to our attacks. How's that possible!", exclaimed Robina, the archer. "It's an undead. We need Etho Elixir to make it vulnerable to our attacks", said Atix, dodging the spikes shot at him.

"Well, I have a vial of Etho with me, take this!", Lavista said, throwing the vial towards Atix. Atix quikly emptied the contents of the vial on his sword and again charged towards teh Aquentis. Its eyes narrowed and in defence, it held up its massive forelimbs to block the attack. However, Atix was too fast for it. Atix jumped and struck his sword right in the center of its chest. The Aquestis let out a groan of agony and pull out the sword from its chest and threw it with Atix.

Meanwhile, Senister had prepared a binding spell which he shot at the Aquentis. The force field around the courtyard had disappeared by now and the king and other courtiers had assembled near the severely injuered and bound Aquentis. "Aah! So this is the ferocious creature. It really is ferocious" , said the king, staring at it. "Jake has really chosen the best", Robina said, "Now I think we should kill it".

"No! We have to know the purpose of its visit. We may get some useful information", said Senister, looking at Robina. Robina nodded. Atix leaned over the Aquentis. "It's alive, not dead yet", said Lavista calmly. Atix stood up with a jerk, "Oh! Yeah, gosh!".Senister rolled his eyes and said, "Ah! kid'o' don't be scared. It is harmless now". Atix bent over the Aquentis and said, "Ah! Now spit out the plans of your army. Tell us everything or else we will kill you".

"Please don't, I'll tell you people everything I know. Just don't kill me", said the Aquentis loudly. "That's better blabber mouth". "Li... Lich... Lichendrone, my leader, our leader, the group of undead's leader sent me here to spy on you people and to know your plans...". "Bunk it, we just want to know your plans now", said Robina, shaking her head in anger. "Arr! The undeads have planned to attack your city and conquer it. They are creating a huge army in the isolated space at the end of the Chaos tunnels. I myself don't know the way to the Barrack chamber, the tunnels are too confusing. They will be attacking your city in about a week or so... Ah! I don't know more about their plans". "Lies", screamed Lavista, standing on her teos. "I.. I.. tell the truth", groaned the Aquentis. "He is telling the truth", said the king. Lavista frowned at the Aquentis and walked back to the castle. "I hope Jake and Norton are alright".
