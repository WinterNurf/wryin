# Further Plans

Back at the way to Chaos tunnels, Jake and Norton had almost reached the entrance to them. "Finally! We are almost there", said Jake. "Yeah, only fifteen to twenty minutes of journey left", replied Norton, trying to make his horse's speed match that of Jake's horse by kicking it on its sides. The more closer they got to the entrance of the Chaos tunnels, the more clearer the sky became. "I have got a strong feeling of negativity", said Jake.

After a few minutes the graveyard could be seen at a distance and something red hovering over it. "I think it's the same red mist we saw back on our way", said Norton. After getting very close to the graveyard, Jake replied, "I'm afraid, you are right". They entered the graveyard premises. They dismounted their horses and tied them to one of the nearby dead trees. Next moment, they heard a shriek which came from somewhere below them. They both stood rooted to the ground. "What was that?", asked Norton, frightened. "How would I know? I am here with you. Let's get moving", said Jake, moving towards the crevice located at the center of the graveyard. As soon as the reached the crevice, another shriek could be heard, louder than the previous one. "This is creeping me up", said Jake.

They could see an underground passage through the crevice. "How are we going to get down there?", asked Norton. "We could tie a rope to that boulder and descend down from it", replied Jake, pointing towards a huge, heavy boulder. Norton nodded and took out a thick coil of rope from his backpack. Jake took the rope from Norton and tied it firmly to the heavy boulder and dropped the loose part of the rope down the crevice. They descended down the rope and were now standing on a rough surface. It was pitch dark inside except for a beam of light entering from the crevice above which lighted a small area below it.

"Wooh! It is very dark in here, we will need a torch", said Jake. "I have got an unlit torch with me, we just need a spark to light it up", said Norton, taking out the unlit torch out of his backpack, "We could use two round and smooth stones to create a spark". After searching for a little time they found perfect stones for creating a spark. Jake rubbed the stones together until they became hot. In a little while he created a spark and they had a blazing fire in the torch. Instantly, everything in the tunnel became visible.

A long passage could be seen ahead, with until torches on the side walls of the tunnel on either side every ten metres. Many stalactites hung from the roof while a few stalagmites scarred the ground. Norton took a torch from the side wall and lit it using the already lit torch. Jake and Norton walked abreast lighting the torches on the side walls. After some time, they could see a wall in the middle of the path which divided into two tunnels. Norton said, "Which way should we go?". Jake hummed 'eena meena maino mo' and then chose the left path. "This one".

They walked towards the left path. "I have a strong feeling that we have chosen the wrong path", said Norton. "Oh! Come on, be optimistic", said Jake, patting Norton on his back. After walking for a long time, they reached a dead end. Norton said, "Be optimistic, huh!", in a sarcastic way. They walked back the path and chose the right path.

After walking for some time they could see two shadowy figures fighting - or dancing - or doing some rituals as Jake thought. As they got closer, they could see a zombie and a human, which was wearing a black cloak trimmed with gold and his head covered with a black hood. They slowly walked towards the scene where the two were fighting, as Jake could now see. After a fierce battle, they body of the zombie lay still on the ground. The human stood perfectly alright with not a single scratch on his body. "Hey!", shouted Jake and started running towards the mysterious man, but before Jake could reach him, he disappeared into thin air leaving behind a greyish-white aura which also disappeared after some time.

"Whoa! What was that?", asked Norton. Jake replied, "I guess he teleported". Suddenly, the men could see red mist emanating out of the zombie's body. Soon after, no flesh could be seen. Only the skeleton was left behind, and the red mist. "Did you see that? Its flesh converted to red mist", said Norton. Jake replied, "This only must have been the cause of the mist we had seen earlier. Undeads would have died on that spot". "But why did they need to go there?". "Maybe they were coming to spy on us". "Well, that is what we are doing". "Yes, but we have to complete our mission quickly. First we have to know their plans, and then form our own". "Well, now let's get moving".

The men continued their journey. After travelling for a long time on a winding path, selecting ways, reaching dead ends and turning back, they finally reached a place where two paths met with a circle like area in the center. One was the path from where they had come. "It seems to me that we have reached our destination, or are very close to it", said Norton. Jake commented, "At last, some optimism". "Hey, I can hear noises. Be quiet and listen", said Norton. After a few moments of silence, Jake nodded. Norton noticed that the voices were coming from a hollow area on the other side of a small, incomplete wall. The hollow area could be seen by leaning over the wall through the empty space between it and the roof. "Hey, Jake! Look at this", Norton said, looking into the big hole below. Jake quickly came and leaned over the wall. The abyss like area below was full of undead. Jake whispered, "This is the time to spy. We have to be patient and keep listening".

"-soon we will conquer the city", an undead was saying. "Yes, soon we will", seconded a vampire. An Aquentis appeared from the gateway of the abyss and announced, "There are some changes in our plans. Instead of attacking the city of Drein in a week's time, we will first assemble our army in these Chaos tunnels. Then we will attack the city directly with full force". "How much time will it take to get ready?", asked a tall, dark undead standing nearby. "About two weeks. Our plans will be delayed only by a week", replied the Aquentis. A conversation took place which was inaudible to Jake and Norton. They could only see strange figures moving in and out of the abyss.

Suddenly, a werewolf looked up and spotted Norton's and Jake's faces sticking out of the wall. "Spies, spies!", shouted the werewolf. Everyone looked at Norton and Jake, who became struck with a bolt of fear. The Aquentis shouted, "Don't let them escape". A vampire clapped his hands, and the next moment, Jake and Norton became surrounded by black fog. Out of the fog appeared hundres of men, which surrounded the men. They looked around in fright, standing still and not able to think.

"Quck, break the teleport tablet", cried Norton. The men quickly took out the tablets and dropped them on the ground, crushing them with their feet. The instant the tablets were crushed, a warp opened up beneath the men and sucked them in. Norton and Jake could see  that they now stood in the castle courtyard, the afternoon sun shining brightly upon them. "Oof! The light is blinding", said Jake. Norton replied, "Well yes, but I am liking it after so much of darkness".

The men went inside the castle to the throne room. "Jake, Norton, how have you been? Was your trip successful?", asked the king. "Yes! It was, Your Majesty", said Norton. Jake added, "Though we had to escape using the teleport tablet. We got spotted by the undeads and they had surrounded us. We were on the verge of death. If Sensiter had not given us the tablets, we would have been killed, or even worse, captured". "So, what information did you get?", the king asked. Norton and Jake narrated the whole story and the plans they heard to the king and everyone else present in the room. "Hmm! So the undead are preparing to attack the city in about two weeks", the king took a deep breath, "So, the time has come when we will have to gather our forces and confront the undead face to face. We have to get our army ready".

Lavista came forward and said, "Battling the undead will be difficult. To make them vulnerable to our attacks, we will need the Etho elixir. A lot of it will be needed". The king said, "Can the required amount be readied in two weeks?". "Yes Your Majesty. I think all the healers together can accomplish this task". "Prepare the elixir and distribute it to everyone in the army. Without it, we are completely useless". "Yes, Your Majesty". Lavista left the room to gather and instruct all the healers.

Atix said, "Robina and I will go prepare the army". Saying this, they walked out of the room. The king ordered, "Senister, go prepare the magicians. Jake, I have to discuss something with you". Everyone went to manage their tasks. Just then, Norton came forward and asked, "What orders for me, Your Majesty?". The king said, "Continue your efforts on spying the undead, this time more concentrated in the Chaos tunnels, but don't neglect other places either". Norton bowed and retired. Jake said, "Your Majesty, I suppose you wanted to discuss something with me". The king replied, "Oh! Yes, come with me to the conference room", Jake and the king headed towars the conference room.

They went and sat there on two chairs, settled down and started talking. "Jake, what should we do? We do not have much idea about the undead army. If we gather all our forces and prepare the army against only the undead, we will have many weak points left. Other kingdoms will get a golden opportunity to attack us". "Your Majesty, do not worry. I have got a plan. We are a mighty kingdom and we also have peaceful relationships with all. The chances of other kingdoms attacking us are very less. We do not even know from where the undead will attack us. We have to station our army everywhere around the kingdom. Drein has to be thoroughly protected. We should get our defensive ring as the outer one, and all the soldiers and weapons can be kept in the inner ring. Archers have a long range. They can finish some of the undead from the inner ring. These rings can be made just at the border of the city. The city wall will also give us a good defence". "Good one, I like it", said the king with more confidence in his voice. "Let the preparation begin, inform everyone". "Yes, Your Majesty. I will immediately go and inform everyone".

Jake rushed to Atix and said, "Atix, I have some work for you". He related his whole plan to him. Atix replied, "Very good plan. I will get the catapults and other things ready". After that, Jake went to all the other members of his team and narrated his plan. Everyone got ready in the preparations for the forthcoming war.

The peace of the city was disrupted as everyone was overwhelmed with fear, first of the war and second, they were afraid of the undead. The place had become an inferno, with preparations of war going on on one side and people panicking on the other.
