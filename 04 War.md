# War

The castle, situated in the center of Drein, was severely protected with armed guards all around it, archers stationed in its towers and huge catapults behind its walls. A huge amount of the Etho elixir had been prepared. Even the walls of the castle had been smeared with it. In the outskirts of Drein, two rings as suggested by Jake had been prepared, one outside the city walls and one inside. All the weapons had been smeared with the Etho elixir and shooters had been prepared which would go up in the air and rain down the elixir on the army of the undead. Archers were stationed on the towers of Drein's wall, protected by armed warriors and magicians. Healers were at a distance, who would keep on healing the troops. All the people of the city had been summoned to live behind the protected walls of the castle. The people in the rest of the kingdom were asked to go into hiding. Two weeks had passed in all these preparations.

After two weeks...

The king, seated in the throne room, stood up and said, "I can hear marching sound. The time of war has come. The undead army's marching sound can be heard till here. Alert everyone". The people who were expecting the undead army to attack that day, got the news soon. The king quickly took his horse and the huge army stationed in the palace and lead it to the war front, inside the main gate of Drein. The army of the undead could be seen marching towards the city on the horizon. Moment by moment, step by step, the army was getting closer.

As the army got quite close, the king said, "Hey! The king of the undead people cannot be seen. The army is not being lead by anyone". A variety of vicious creatures could be seen in the undead army. There were zombies, vampires, vyrewatches, Aquentises, ghouls, skeletal warriors and archers, and ugly giants. They were followed by a pack of werewolves and vevrinths flying around over them. The evening sun set, leaving just an orange glow in the sky. The Drein army moved out of the city premises and the king ordered that the city gates be closed.

"Rain the Etho elixir on them. Archers, shoot". The shooters were shot in the air and a silver coloured transluscentn liquid started raining over the undead army. Because of this, the undeads became vulnerable to attacks and also became a little weaker. The arrows of the archers also rained on the undead army. Many undeads died due to them. For a moment, the whole undead army was covered in red mist and nothing was visible.

The king asked Jake, "What is this red, misty thing?". Jake replied, "When an undead dies, a red mist is left behind". The army of the undead appeared out of the mist, charging towards Drein's army. The king nodded his head, looking at Lavista. Lavista nodded in agreement and shot a flame arrow in the sky. The next moment, many creeky noises could be heard. The catapults had shot huge boulders directly onto the undead army. The archers were still shooting. As soon as the boulders started falling, the undead army was again covered in red mist. It remained like that for a few minutes, after which many arrows shot out of it.

"Raise the shields", the king ordered. The troops raised their shields to protect themselves from the arrows. When the mist cleared, it could be seen that almost half of the undead army had depleted. The catapults and archers had not stopped shooting as the undead army had come very close to Drein's army. Now, the archers who were stationed in front of the outer ring started shooting.

The undead began to organise themselves in two parallel rows. From behind them a huge giant came running between the rows and jumped on the army of Drein, instantly killing a few soldiers. Jake, who was seeing this, analysed what was going to happen and so had ordered the other soldiers to move away from the spot where the giant had jumped. As soon as the giant landed, a catapult fired a huge boulder on the giant. It shattered on him, injuring him badly. As soon as the giant fell towards the ground, Jake started running towards the giant, jumped, and landed on the ground beside him. He quickly climbed the giant's chest and pierced it with his blade. After some time, the giant's head, which was a little raised, fell to the ground and red mist started emanating from its body.

The giants in the undead army on the other side roared with indignance. However, it seemed that they had become a little frightened because the undead army had charged forward but they were left behind. The zombies, human like with very little skin on them, and bare flesh with a little bone visible in most parts, walked in a strange manner, as if they were limping. The confronted the soldiers of Drein face to face, though they were weaker and were killed easily. The vevrinths, looking exactly like humans but with a very fair complexion and huge, jet black wings, started flying around over Drein's army. They had small, pit like depressions on their palm from which they shot purple coloured spiked balls of energy, which killed a few soldiers, and were killing more. The healers who were concealed behind the city walls were successful in healing a few soldiers. 

Senister, with the help of the other magicians, created a large force field around the city of Drein so that any of the undead creature could not enter. Robina ordered the archers, "Take close aim and shoot those flying creatuers. They are costing our army too much". The vevrinths started being shot by the archers. The sky got covered with red mist. However, it did not disrupt the archers' accuracy. The vampires and werewolves came in and started attacking the army and the vyrewatches, very much like vampires but with a pair of bat like wings, appeared in the sky. Robina said, "Don't leave those vyrewatches. Shoot them also"". The Aquentises and the ghouls joined the battle on the ground with the zombies and others while the skeletal archers, warriors and giants stood behind. Atix ordered that the catapults be used for the undead remaining behind. All the archers were ordered to concentrate on the flying creatures. Huge boulders started being fired from behind the city walls on to the undead army afar. In the way to that place, the boulders also hit some of the airborne creatures. Jake said, "Very good. The catapults are really helping".

All the skeletal archers were dead and the skeletal warriors also had significantly depleted. The giants were not killed but were injured. Those remaining undeads joined the battle now. The king ordered, "Release the giant sabretooths". Sabretooths are huge, tiger like creatures, white in colour with huge, saber like teeth, true to their name. Sabertooths are known to be the enemy of the undead. Many of these sabertooths ran out of a gate from inside the city and started tearing the undead with their huge teeth. "Wow, this is good defence. The archers are taking care of the vyrewatches and vevrinths, the soldiers are killing zombies, ghouls and skeletons. The sabretooths prefer big ones, so they will of course battle the giants and some small creatures too who come in their way. The vampires and werewolves are also being given tough competition by our troops. Well, but the Aquentises are gaining over us. Come Atix, Jake, we shall slay them", said the king, his boldness and strength of previous wars returning to him. "Yes, Your Majesty", replied Jake and Atix in a chorus.

The king said, "I think we should replenish the Etho elixir on our blades. The undead are appearing to become more weaker when more of it is used". "Well figured, Your Majesty", Atix answered. Jake seconded, "Your Majesty, we have another shower of Etho elixir left. We can rain it down again to make the undead further weaker". The king replied, "No Jake, we shall use it if our army is losing badly. The healers are doing quite a good job and so our army is not depleting. I don't think this is the last war against the undead. If not used, the elixir can be used later". In all this talking, they were slaying zombies and skeletons. Atix said, "Come on now, to the Aquentises".

Everyone got into form, took their horses and rode towards where the Aquentises were gathered, rampaging Drein's army. It was only in this part where the army of the city of Drein was losing. Jake, Atix and the king smeared the Etho elixir on their swords and each charged towards an Aquentis. The Aquentises started battling them but seemed to be too strong for them to defeat one on one. "Hey, let's all take one together. That way we will be able to kill it easily", Atix suggested. Everyone came together and charged towards an Aquentis. The king charged directly in front of the Aquentis. As soon as he was very near to the Aquentis, he pull the reins of his horse with a jerk. The horse suddenly reared up and push the Aquentis with his forelegs. It fell to the ground with a big THUD. Atix quickly jumped off his horse and stabbed the Aquentis with a dagger he had in his pocket. Though this kind of attack would have been insufficient to kill an Aquentis, the dagger had struck on its weak spot and so it died on the spot.

"Well! One down, a few more to go", Jake said, galloping towards another Aquentis. When his horse reached near it, the Aquentis took to the air and came behind the horse. Jake jumped off his horse, pointing his swords backwards. It impaled the Aquentis who was following the horse close behind. "Nice kill Jake, using the Aquentis' speed to drive the blade through it", said the king. "What a fluke!", Jake thought. Like this, one by one, they started taking down the Aquentises.

On the other side, all the giants had been killed by the sabretooths. The vevrinths and vyrewatches were also down by now. The zombies, ghouls and skeletal warriors were almost totally diminished. The remaining ones were taken care of by the magicians. Only the vampires, werewolves and Aquentises remained. The sabretooths had come on to kill the Aquentises so the kind, Atix and Jake moved to the vampires. After a tough battle with the Aquentises, the vampires were too easy to handle for them.

"We have almost won. Only a few undead are left. We can slay them all", the king shouted. It was a very tough competiton for the remaining undead as the archers, warriors and magicians were all concentrating on them. The healers were also healing more efficiently as they had to heal less people. Till dawn, all the undeads had been killed except for a few werewolves. The werewolves started running away as the sun was about to rise and there were only five of them left against the whole army of Drein. "Hey! They are running. Don't let them escape", said the king, giving chase with Atix and Jake. Their horses were galloping at full speed but still they could only match the speed of the werewolves.
