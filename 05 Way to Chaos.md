# Way to Chaos

After a little run in the woods outside the city, they saw the werewolves disappearing into a hole in the ground. "Hey! Where are they going? What's that?", Atix asked. Jake replied, "I think it is some kind of hole. Let's follow them". All the three rode on to the hole and got down from the horses. "Oh! I just remembered. The horses Norton and I had taken earlier. They would still be tied near the graveyard", Jake said. The king replied, "We do not have time to go and rescue those horses now. But this time, we will not tie our horses here. We will let them free. I don't think they will run too far from here. They will surely be found near the river. Now come. We do not have much time".

All of them came near the hole and leaned over to see inside it. "Hmm! Not very deep. We can easily jump inside it", saying this, Atix jumped inside the hole and disappeared. Jake and the king followed. As soon as they reached down, they saw a long way ahead of them, and just a few paces away, Norton was standing. "Hey! Norton! What are you doing here?", Jake asked, very happy on seeing his old partner. "Greetings! Your Majesty, Jake, Atix. Your Majesty, you told me to continue spying in the Chaos tunnels. Till now I have discovered many things. But first tell me, what news of Drein and how have you come here?", Norton asked. The king answered, "Well, the undead army attacked Drein and we won. A pack of werewolves who were left, escaped, so we followed them. They went into a hole, we descended it and saw you". "Yes, and this hole is just a five to ten minute journey from Drein", Atix added.

"Oh, so the wolves I saw running from here. Needless to say, they had a very frightened look on their faces. But now, the main matter of concern is that these Chaos tunnels have an entrance very near to the city. That makes Drein very vulnerable", Norton said. Jake replied, "Well, that is right, but we cannot do anything about it. You tell us about your adventures". Norton started saying, "I did not know about this entrance of these tunnels, so I entered from the crevice in the graveyard. I went along the same route by which Jake and I had gone earlier. I did not find any undead till I reached the abyss. The abyss was also completely empty. I managed to jump into the abyss and exit from there. Further ahead, the paths were very confusing. I did not know where I was going and I had also got cut off from the rest of my team. In the way, I confronted many dangerous creatures in this cave but not any undead. Facing the obstacles and finding my path, I have reached here. I jumped here from there", Norton finished, pointing towards a high ledge.

"But how can we escape from this chamber?" The ledge from which Norton jumped cannot be scaled from here. The hole from which we came is just like a hole in the middle of the roof. It is unreachable. It is just this path here and a little room ahead, with some crates lying there. I think we're stranded!", Atix exclaimed. Jake went ahead to the little room to investigate it. Everyone followed. Atix, excitement, sprinted behind Jake and pushed him by mistake. Jake fell on a crate and smashed it. He suddenly disappeared into the ground.

"Oww. That hurts", Jake's voice came from somewhere below the ground. Norton went and looked in the crate, which had a hole in it and Jake was lying below it. "Wow Jake! You've discovered an exit from this room!", he exclaimed. Atix said, "You should give the credit to me". Everyone left above jumped down the hole and landed on a very smooth surface. The king lended his hand to Jake. Taking support, he got up and dusted his pants, "Thank you, Your Majesty".

A very long path could be seen ahead. Till their vision could go, they saw a very small light green speck in the end. "Now we just have to keep walking", Norton said. Atix complained, "Oh! I hate this darkness. Can't we have a little light here?". Jake answered, "Indeed we can, but we have enough light here to see our path. We should not waste the torches". After walking for several minutes, the green speck got bigger and the cave was filled with light. The bright yellow light seemed to have no source, it just spread in the cave evenly. The path widened into a huge hall like chamber. The green speck was a waterfall with light green water flowing in it. It was situated at the end of the hall, after a small passage from it. Three different paths emanated from the great hall. The paths could be seen bending and so only the walls of the cave could be seen.

"Hey! Look at that waterfall. It has greenish coloured water flowing in it", the king said, pointing towards it. A loose ring flew out of his finger and ended up in the waterfall. The ring instantly got heated so much that it caught fire and varpourised in front of their eyes. "Whoa! What was that now?", Atix asked. Jake replied, "The water seems to be very dangerous. We have to be careful so that it does not touch us".

The king noticed a gear like metal wheel fixed on the wall near the waterfall. "Now what is that? And what are the funny little shapes carved into it?". During all this time, Norton had slipped out from the hall onto a path leading to a chamber. In the hall, Atix looked around and asked, "Where's Norton?". The very next moment, Norton appeared from one path and shouted, "Look what I found!". Everyone turned towards Norton, who held a diamond shaped piece of metal in his hand. "I found it on a pedestal at the end of one path", he said. "Now, what is that?", Jake asked. The king was still looking at the metal wheel near the waterfall and saw that it had exactly the same diamon shaped carving as Norton had found.

"Look here. Maybe tat piece will fit it here. Give me the piece". Norton handed over the piece to the king. He took it and pushed it in the carving made in the wheel. "A perfect fit", he said. Atix suggested, "Maybe there is one metal piece at the end of each path starting form this hall. We have to take all the pieces and put and put them into the wheel". "Well, that seems to be inevitable, but only if there are such pieces at the end of the other two paths. We will make teams. Atix and I will go and look in one path. Your Majesty, you and Norton can go and investigate the other path", Jake said. Everyone agreed to Jake's plan and the king ordered, "Let's move on".

He and Norton selected a path and entered it. They went ahead and turned around the bend. After walking for some time, the king stepped on a very thin, hardly visible thread. The next moment, two arrows from either side of the wall shot horizontally towards the oppisite walls. One of them went between Norton's legs and one just missed the king's head. "Oh! What a miss. We have to be careful", said the king. The king got a little frightened and froze on the spot, but Norton comforted him and urged him to go on. After some time, they saw that their path was blocked by a wall like structure which was almost half as high as the roof of the tunnel. "I suppose we will have to climb this wall and jump on the other side", Norton said. They both started scaling the wall and reached the top.

"Aah! What's that?", Norton shouted loudly with fear. The ground on the other side of the wall was laid with small stalagmites all over till a small distance. "Okay! Now let's stop here for a few seconds and catch our breath. Then one by one, we will jump over to the other side of the stalagmites", the king suggested, but it was in vain. The very next moment, the wall started falling onto the stalagmites. "Jump quickly, and hold my hands", the king ordered Norton. They both jumped, holding hands. The king managed to escape the stalagmites by an inch.

"Help me. Aah!", Norton shouted, as he was going to land directly on the pointed spikes. The king, who was holding his hands, pulled him towards himself and made him jump over his shoulders ahead of him. "Oh! Thank you, Your Majesty. You saved my life", Norton said. The king answered, "That was my duty. Now come quickly. We have to find the metal piece, if it exists". Norton replied, "Yes, but we shall return if this path separates out into two or joins another path". The king nodded in agreement.

After going further, the walls of the tunnel narrowed and stalactites appeared on the roof. The king and Norton, ignorant of them and the dangers they had to face ahead, were walking steadily but with caution. Norton stepped on a raised, tile like piece in the ground which got pushed in by his weight. "Oh! Oh! Trouble!", he thought, and shouted, "Run!". He held the king's hand and pulled him while running very fast. The king also gathered speed and sprinted ahead. Behind them, the stalactitel started falling, layer by layer. They ran till the stalactites above had all fallen and they were quite ahead of them. "Now, you saved my life, see. It was a close miss", the king said. Norton smiled and replied, "I just hope we do find the piece. All of our efforts shouldn't go waste".

The path ahead was straight and plain. The king and Norton easily crossed the path and reached a chamber in which a pedestal was placed in the middle. On top of it was a gold coloured sun shaped piece. The floor was yellowish brown in colour, just like that of a desert. On the floor, beside the cylindrical pedestal were many tiles arranged in rings made by three concentric circles. The roof had many rectangular slits, directly overhead the tiles.

"This room is strange. Anyways, let's get the metal piece". However, Norton was not listening to the king. He was busy reading an inscription carved on the front wall, opposite the entrance to the chamber. "What's there in it?", the king looked at the inscription and asked. Norton replied, "It says that only the most witty person will get the reward". "What does that mean? Sounds like a puzzle to me. Whatever it might be, I'm taking the piece", the king said, and stepped on to a tile on the outermost ring. The tile was forced in by his weight and three rectangular blocks came out of the slits in the roof and fell on the three tiles in the middle ring in front of him. Norton said, "It surely is a puzzle".

The king switched to the tile beside the one on which he was standing. The rightmost blocks rose up into the slit and another one came down, blocking three tiles in front of the king. He said, "Incredible". Norton moved on to a tile which was opposite the king's tile on the outermost ring. The block in the middle layer which was directly in front of the king rose up and a block fell in front of Norton. The king moved on to the tile in front of him. Three blocks behind the king in the outermost ring slammed down on the tiles. The block in front of Norton rose up and three blocks fell in front of the king in the innermost ring.

Norton took one step forward to the middle ring. Upto one tile besides Norton was hit by blocks falling from the roof, making him completely trapped. "Help! I'm trapped", Norton shouted. The king replied, "Wait a minute. I'm confused". The king had only two tiles to move on to, one on the left and one on the right. The king moved one tile to the left. A block fell on the tile on which he was standing before. The block to Norton's left rose up. Norton moved to the only tile remaining on his left. This time, the king became trapped in exactly the same manner in which Norton was trapped before.

Norton was left completely empty, with no blocks surrounding him. The king could not see anything, as everything from the roof to the ground was walled with the blocks, which made a tiny room like structure to conceal him inside. "Aah! Help me. Now I am trapped", he shouted. Norton replied, "You're fully trapped and I am left completely free to move anywhere". The king said, "What are you waiting for then? Go, take your prize". Norton took one step forward to the innermost ring, directly in front of the metal piece. No activity of the blocks was observed this time. Norton grabbed the gear on the pedestal and all the blocks on the tiles rose up. Norton said, smiling, "I have got it". The king replied, "Well, now I can see that very clearly. Good job".

On the other side, Atix and Jake had almost reached the gear chamber. Their path was a very long one but they did not face any difficulty in crossing it. Atix said, "How long will it take us to reach the end of this path? I'm starting to get tired". Jake shrugged.

After some time, they reached the gear chamber. Jake spotted the gear, which was star shaped and silver in colour. "Ah! At last! Let's take it and get going". Atix went and tried to grab the gear, but as soon as he had touched it, a great amount of energy erupted from the pedestal and pushed him backwards, away from the gear. It sent him flying across the chamber and he smashed onto a nearby wall of the chamber.

"Oww!", Atix cried in pain. Suddenly, the roof above started shaking. The center part of the roof crumbled to dust and down fell a huge giant, but not as the usual ones that were seen in the war. It looked more ferocious, like a wild beast, fully coloured in shades of red, with huge, yellow fangs emanating downwards from its jaw. It landed down on the pedestal, which broke and crumbled to dust. The sudden force exerted on the ground made it vibrate vigorously. It roared loudly and beat its chest with its fists.

"That's so ferocious. Looks dangerous", Atix said. Jake replied, "Whatever it might be, it is evident that we have to confront it before getting the gear". "Okay the, Charge!", saying this, Atix took out his sword and started running towards the big, red giant. "Hey, wait. Do not forget about the Etho elixir", Jake shouted out from behind. It was too late and Atix had already pushed in his sword into the giant's foot. The giant groaned in pain. It lost its balance and fell down backwards. Atix's sword was still stuck in its foot. "That is strange. This monster does not seem to be an undead. It got hurt without the Etho elixir", Atix said. The monster quickly got up and took out the sword from its foot. It then flung it towards Atix. However, Jake being quick, jumped in front of Atix and blocked the flying sword with his own. The flying sword was coming with so much force that instead of flying away, it stayed in contact with Jake's sword for a while and then dropped down. Atix quickly picked it up and come into form.

"Atix, lend me your sword", said Jake, helping himself and taking the sword from Atix's hands. He ran and jumped in front of the giant. He quickly slahed off his jaws and then impaled the two swords, one onti its chest and one onto its head. Jake pushed the giant to the ground and landed safely. The red monster fell down dead. Jake and Atix went and took out their swords. "At last. It's dead", Jake said. Atix replied, "Yes, but the thing we came for is the gear. Maybe this monster was protecting it. Now we will have to find it in this mess. Everything has been converted to dust. The gear would be somewhere beneath it".

Atix and Jake moved to the center of the chamber. They dug their hands into the sand like dust and moved them through it, trying to locate the gear. Suddenly, Atix's hands struck a hard object. He removed it and saw that it was the gear. Jake said, "Well done Atix. Now let's return to the waterfall".

The king and Norton had already reached the waterfall when Atix and Jake arrived. The king asked, "We found our gear. What about you?". Jake replied, "We too found it". The king received all the gears and went and fixed them in the wheel near the waterfall. A huge rock slab appeared from the archway and divided the flow of the water into tow. All the four men crossed the bridge over a pool of the substance flowing in the waterfall and passsed from beneath the slab.
