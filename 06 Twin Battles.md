# Twin Battles

A long passage lay ahead of them. It was almost perfectly straight, and a chamber was visible at its end, with a moving figure in it. As they got closer to the chamber, they could see two moving figures in it. Finally when they reached the chamber, they could see two titans roaming around in it.

"What are those huge giant creatures?", Norton asked. Atix replied, "Those are titans. They are made up of the forces of nature. These two which we see ahead are made of the elements of steel and rock". "So now, do we have to fight them?", Jake asked. Atix replied, "Titans are generally aggressive in nature. It is inevitable that we have to fight them". The king said, "It would be difficult to fight creatures made of rock and steel. Even our swords can break". Jake added, "Yes, that is true. We won't use our swords this time. If they break, we will be in trouble in our journeys ahead". "Okay, then let's charge", said Norton, and ran in to the chamber. "Don't they look smaller than usual?", Jake asked. Atix answered, "They are dwarves".

Norton, who had by now reached into the chamber, had seeked the attention of the two titans and was having trouble saving himself from their attacks. However, he seemed to be safe as he was quick and was running between the legs of the titans whereas the titans, being huge and heavy, were very slow. "Hey! Come on guys! Help me!", Norton shouted from inside the chamber. Everyone quickly became alert and entered the chamber ahead where the rock titan and the steel titan were ambushing Norton. "Come on! We got to help him. He already looks down with fatigue", cried out the king. Atix announced, "And no swords. Oh yes! I just remembered, harm their eyes. That's the only part of them we can attack". Jake said, "That is a good idea, but how do we reach there? They're as high as a three storey building". "Yes, and we cannot even use weapons", the king added. Jake said, "Maybe we can find a way to escape while fighting".

Atix, being bold, tried to attack the steel titan directly. He attracted the attention of both the titans, who started attacking him. In the meantime, Norton, getting a change, easily climbed the rock titan and reached its neck. He climed up his head and stuck in his hands into the eyes of the rock titan. "Oww! Even its eyes are made up of rocks", Norton said, jumping off from the titan. Atix replied, "What else could they be? You expect them to be made of grapes?". The king broke in the conversation, "Enough of that now. No time for your jokes. Look, Norton has done his work".

Norton's attack really did seem to have some effect on the rock titan as it now covered its eyes with his hands and was out of balance, tripping all around the chamber. "Mind yourselves. Don't get crumpled under their feet", Jake shouted. All the four men sheltered themselves under the entrance of the chamber, while the rock titan fell down on the steel titan. It was apparent that they both had suffered serious injuries. Both the titans quickly stood up and looked towards the men. The rock titan's eye hadn't taken much damage. The steel titan raised its leg and suddenly banged it on the ground, creating an encore. Just like in an avalanche, a pile of rocks fell behind the four men, blocking the entrance to the chamber.
