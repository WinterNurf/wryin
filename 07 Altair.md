# Altair

Both the titans charged towards the four men, who had to take out their swords to defend themselves. "Oh! Oh! We are trapped", Jake shouted. The king said, "Now we will have to use our weapons. But be careful, do not break your swords. The best way is to chip off small pieces of their flesh, or whatever it is". Everyone agreed to this statement. Norton advised, "And remember, offence is the best form of defence". Atix shouted, "Okay the, charge!". All the four men charged with their swords out. They started chipping off the titans. The titans groaned in agony and retaliated. The titans, because of their huge size, posed a great threat to each and every one of the men and so they gained the upper hand. After some time, everyone in the chamber was badly tired, except the titans who seemed to have an unlimited boost of stamina. The fight was in a scene in which all the four men were cornered by the titans, who were ready to make the final blow.

Suddenly, a loud voice came from behind the titans, "Stop. Leave them". In an instant, the titans freezed, and then they smashed against each other, breaking out into more than thousands of pieces. A lot of dust had blown and the whole chamber was covered with pieces of rock and steel flying here and there. The titans were destroyed, but visibility remained zero for several minutes. Slowly, everything cleared and a human like figure became visible. A man was standing in the middle of the chamber, wearing white, long robes, with ancient scripts embroidered on joints. His head was covered with a white hood, which was also trimmed with the ancient script. He was wearing black coloured gloves and stockings, with shoes of the same colour. He was levitating in the air with his arms stretched. The power of his aura was so intense that it could be seen in shining blue colour to the four men standing in the corner, completely frozen with fear.

Slowly, the aura disappeared from around the man and he dropped to the ground, losing consciousness. Atix said, "He saved our lives. Who is he?". Jake replied, "Whoever he is, he is very powerful. He does not seem to be dangerous. And look! He is lying there unconscious. Now it is our turn to help him". Everyone came near the man lying on the floor. Norton said, "Someone, raise his hood". Nobody moved. Everyone was too frightened to accomplish this task. "Never mind, we have to continue our journey. But remember, we cannot leave our life saviour in a state like this. Jake, take him on your shoulders. Now, let's move on", the king announced.

Jake did as he was instructed and then everyone moved towards the exit of the chamber. The ground was still littered with pieces of the titans, and that made all the four men remember the time, just a few minutes ago, in which they were on the verge of death. As soon as they exited the chamber, they reached another one, smaller than the previous one. Atix said, "What is this, just wall, no exit. These Chaos tunnels are getting on my nerves". Norton answerd, "Be observant Atix. Look at the roof. There is a big hole in it".

Jake put the man in the white robes down on the ground and have his opinion, "We won't be able to climb up till there. There must be some specific way. Till we figure it out, I will tend to this man". The king, Atix and Norton settle down in one corner to discuss possible ways of climbing up to the hole while Jake kneeled down beside the unconscious man. He tried many things to wake him up. He shook him, sprinkled water over him, but every time he failed. At last, he decided to raise his hood. As soon as he touched it, the man caught Jake's hand gently and put it aside. Then he stood up slowly and looked up at the hole in the roof. He then looked at the three men who were gazing at him in amazement. He stretched his arms and then joined them in front of him, his aura coming into visibility. In a split second, all the people were above the hole, in a beautiful formed garden with white fencing all around it. It had a wooden gate, which was also painted in white. Outside, there were only trees, trees and trees.

The garden had a huge, beautiful, white coloured fountain of water. There were eight, beautifully carved mahogany benches, two on each side of the square garden. It had patches of land full of flowers - roses, sunflowers, carnations and many more on the four corners of the garden. Grape vines covered two opposite fences of the garden, those adjacent to the gate side. There was a path around the fountain and in a cross shape which connected the fountain path to the centres of the edtes of the garden. "Wow, what a beautiful garden. At last, some light...", said Atix. Jake inturrpedted in between, "Look, this man who teleported us here is down again. He has fainted".

The king said, "What great power he has got. Without any incantations, magical words etc. he has brought us here. We need to save this man. He may prove to be very useful". Norton added, "I think we should wait here till this man recovers. He looks to be weak. Let him rest there for a while".

Everyone went different ways. Norton went and peeped down the hole, looking at the chamber from which they had come. Atix went and refreshed himself with the water from the fountain while Jake started picking grapes from the vines. The king went and sat on a bench, staring at the mysterious man. After some time, Atix had brought a pail full of water, Norton some flowers, and Jake some bunches of grapes for the unconscious man. The king kept on sitting on the bench.

Norton kept the flowers beside him and Atix sprinkled water over his face. It seemed to rejuvinate him and he slowly shifted his position. He seemed to be too weak to sit or stand up. The king came forward and helped him get up. He gave him support and lead him to a bench and made him sit down. "Are you fine now?", Jake asked. The man answered, "Yes! Thank you for saving me". Jake replied, "No, we should thank you. You saved our lives from the titans. Here, have some grapes, You would be hungry". Atix added, "And here are some flowers and a pail of water to freshen you up".

The man ate and drank and his strength increased. His head was still covered with the hood. After this, he sighed and slowly lifted up his hood. "Ah! I need fresh air". The hood revealed a bright, radiant face which had many scars on it. The king was staring at him in utter shock. "Altair!", he exclaimed. "Yes, Your Majesty, it is me", Altair, the mysterious man replied. "Hey! Hey! What is going on here? You both know each other?", Norton asked. Atix said, "What is happening around here? Well, but it does seem that you would know each other. 'Atlair' looks like a man of Drein".

The king banged his fists on the bench in anger and got up. "This man cannot be one of us. He shall not travel with us anymore". Altair pleaded, "Please Your Majesty. Let me explain. It was not my fault". "I do not want to hear any explanations. Your case has completely gone through by me personally. Even I could not find any loopholes". "Your Majesty! Please. Give me one chance. I will prove myself. Loopholes were not created on paper. The files completely blame me. Yes, they do, but it is someone else. I have been trapped". Jake interrupted the conversation, "What is happening? What is Altair's crime?". "Altair was banished from Disdain. How dare he show up here again?", the king roared in anger. "Your Majesty, I have still not got my answer. Please, calm down and tell me properly".

"Take that traitor out of my sight". Jake pleaded the king to calm down. Finally he started saying, "He is a traitor. Long ago, he was a very good and trusted friend of mine. But he turned traitor. He is a murderer. In his lust for the throne of Disdain, he killed my queen and also the prince. He would even have killed me. But I came to know of his plans on time and got him arrested". Jake intervened, "Altair claims that it was not his fault. Maybe we should give him one chance. After all, he is our life saviour. If not for him, we all would have been dead people. We owe him quite much". Altair said, "Please Your Majesty. Let me join you. I will even prove my innocence". "How? How can I know that you are not guilty?", the king asked. "This is what I have been trying to tell you. They are not dead. I have seen them alive myself, in flesh and blood. The bodies which you saw and created were not theirs'. The undeads have been manking plans to capture Drein since ages. They were the ones who captured the queen and the prince. They did this because they thought it would weaken you. All this time I have stayed in these Chaos tunnels, battling the ferocious creatures there. I have seen them here once but now they have then tham somewhere else. All the time I was seeking them, striving to prove my innocence".

The king believed him completely, but interrogated, "How do I believe you?". Jake said, "We have to believe him now. We have no other choice". Everyone pleaded the king to let Altair join them. Finally, he agreed and forgave Altair. "Okay, now let's continue our journeys", the king said.

"Wait!", Atix shouted. "First, Altair, tell us the secret of your powers". Altair replied, "There is no secret to that. It all comes with experience. I have mastered the art of using my energy reserve and accomplish superhuman tasks, without any incantations or magical resources". Norton said, "Okay the, we'll take lessons from you". "Affirmative", Altair replied. "Now let's move on. We have to remember that we are on a mission", said Atix. The king added, "And the purpose of our mission is getting clearer. We have to succeed".

The team of five now moved out of the garden, rejuvenated with the strengthened cause of their expedition. They were walking on a naturally made mud path which was surrounded by the woods. The trees were very beautiful, every individual leaf was glossy and dark green in colour. There was not a speck of dust around. There was a magical sheen around the trees. It looked as if a river of sparkles was flowind down the tree from the top to bottom. Many beautiful bushes decorated the ground, accompanied by various ferns. The weather was cool and windy, with a few nimbus clouds suspended in the sky. The sunlight did not reach the ground but the radiance of the trees made the whole forest glow.

"Wah! What a beautiful place", said the king. "Yes, it truly is", said Jake, stopping to look at a nearby flower. Suddenly, a troop of apeons appeared swinging on branches and jumping from one tree to another. Apeons are monkey like creatures with six limbs, four arms and two legs. They had long yellow eyes and a midnight blue coloured sparkling fur coat. It had a ribbon like, long tail. An apeon landed on a branch and started staring at Jake, who exclaimed, "They scare me. Look, that one is staring at me". Altair moved closed to Jake and said, "Don't be scared. Their nature is not aggressive". "Now move on. We have to accomplish our task as soon as possible".
