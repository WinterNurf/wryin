# The Burrow

After walking for some time on the path, everyone spotted a whole army of squirrels rushing in the opposite direction. They looked horrified and frightened. "All these squirrels look so cute running like this", Norton said. Suddenly, a little squirrel bumpled into Altair's leg. It looked up at him, quickly got up and ran away. "Be careful, little one", Altair shouted to it. After walking further, a pack of Enincas, a breed of overgrown black coloured furless dogs with a ferocious face and huge teeth, two of which stuck out of its jaw, came running in the same way as the squirrels. At the same time, a lot of sparrows passed from above the sky. At the sight of the fierce dogs, all the men froze. They remained like that till all the dogs had gone. After that, they eased a little.

"I think there is something fishy around here. All the animals look so frightened!", Atix exclaimed. The king said, "Let's go and investigate. There must be something which is scaring even the huge dogs". After this, they saw many small rabbits, different kinds of birds and other small creatures running. "Look, Wibs", cried out Jake. Huge eagle like birds, brown in colour and with a huge amount of feathers, a big wing span and a less frightening face were flying towards the men with great speed. All of them passed above the men's heads. However, the last one of them landed in front of them. It was at this time that they acknowledged their huge size. The Wibs were almost as big as three fourthe the size of the men. "Run! Danger", it tried to say but all that came out was a screech.

"There is definitely something big out there. I can sense it", Altair said. The king ordered, "Come on, we got to investigate whatever there is". Everyone moved forward in a definity rhythm. Although they were bound to get frightened, the magical woods seemed to rejuvenate them at every second and they felt fresher and fresher. They had taken just a few steps when they spotted huge flying objects in the sky. They were flying very high and would be almost double the size of a fully grown man. "My god, Kreigens. These are the dark green ones. Look, they have light green slits over their body. Though a weaker breed, it scares me that even these huge creatures are running away", Norton said. Jake replied, "Maybe there are titans out there. The ones which we confronted were so huge". "Yes, and there were dwarves", Atix added. Altair said, "No, no. It can't be a titan. I can sense the auro of something huge, something very frightening, something really evil". "Of course, it would be, if even the Kreigens have been scared. Come on team, move forward. We have to check out what there is", the king gave the orders.

Everyone now moved in new spirits, curious to know what lied in front of them. After a short trek, the forest path widened into a circle which then narrowed again and the path continued. Warm sunlight filled the clearing, and in the middle lied a great hole, with a radius of almost four metres. Atix went up to the hole and peeped down. Light filled the hole to a distance, but after that it was completely dark. "Don't tell me that the Chaos tunnels have started again. I am sick of them". Altair replied, "Do not worry. This, I suppose, is the abode of the creature, which we are looking for. I can sense a very strong energy just beneath us".

Norton took a stone and hurled it down the hole. Nothing happened for a while and everything was very still. Suddenly, the earth started shaking. Everyone moved away from the hole. "Is it an earthquake?", Jake shouted. No one replied. Everyone was frozen on to their spot. The earth started shaking more vigorously and finally, a huge, worm like creature came out of the hole. Only a part of it was visible above the ground, the rest was in the hole. A second later, it shot up and completely came out of the hole. The creature was worm like, almost double the height of the titans in length, and a little smaller than the hole in width. It was fully covered in a hard shell, with sharp spikes at its back. However, the shell did not cover the eyes, mouth and antennae. It was fully coloured dark grey.

Atix said, "We surely are going to have a hard time". Jake pulled out his sword and charged towards the creature. As Jake came near, the creature twisted its tail and struck Jake with it. He was sent off flying in the air. He fell against a nearby tree. "Oww! It feels like all my bones are broken", Jake groaned. Norton suggested, "I think we will have to distract it. Atix, I will charge from the front, you go from behind. The others can attack from the sides". The king added, "Good idea, but first we will have to break its shell. Now, charge!".

Swords drawn out, everyone charged from different sides at the creature. It got confused, started spinning, but seeing that the men weren't stopping, it stood straight, its eyes tightly closed. Everyone struck its shell at the same time. Recovering from the recoil of the might blow, the men saw that the creature was recovering from the blows, after which it stood unaffected. The creature got wild and started ambushing the men in a strange manner, jumping around here and there. "It's gone crazy. Everyone defent yourself", cried the kng. Altair thought, "We can never battle the creature like this. Its shell is refusing to break. I will have to think of something".

He went and hid behind a far off tree. His eyes started glowing blue. He was levitating above the ground. He created an energy ball, black in colour, with yellow sparks flowing around it. He fired it at the creature when it had become huge. The ball travelled with great speed and hit the creature. It seemed that it had absorbed the ball. However, the area where it had struck became dark. CRACK! Suddenly a loud voice came and a part of the creature's shell fell down, exposing its slimy, pale yellowish skin. Its segments clearly came into view. The creature screeched, groaned in pain, and dived back into its burrow. Altair, on the other side, fell to the ground, weakened.

He helped himself and sat down, taking support from the nearby tree. "Altair, great shot", Jake cried. The king said, "You shouldn't have done it though. Look what you have done to youself. You look so weak". Altair replied, "Do not worry about me, it was necessary. I will rest here, you all go after it". The king said, "As you say. Let's follow it now. Into the burrow". Everyone nodded. "But I'm afraid", Atix started saying, "We do not know how deep the hole goes. If it is very deep, we would break our bones". "Do not worry. The creature, I can sense, has not gone very deep, which means that the hole is quite shallow. You'll survive", Altair told Atix. "By your last words, you scare me even more". "No time for petty talk. We have a mission to accomplish. Maybe the creature is healing itself inside. Quick everyone, hurry".

Everyone stood near the circumference of the burrow. Jake was the first to jump, followed by the king, Atix, who was pushed by Norton who came after him. The tunnel underneath the burrow bent, providing a rough slide, which opened up into a big room like structure. The creature was lying inside, its segments arranged compactly and inverted, as if it was trying to hide its exposed skin. "Oww, my skin is totally bruised", Norton complained. The creature moved, and quickly turned towards the men. It was still hiding its exposed skin.

"We have an advantage here. If it keeps standing like this, it won't be able to attack, and if it exposes its skin, we will easily kill it", Atix said. The king replied, "That is true, but in this form, we can't attack it. We have to strike at the exposed part of its skin". Jake suggested, "Even though our attacks do not affect it, they do have some impact. They knock it off a little. I think we should just keep striking". Everyone went near the creature with no fear. They started attacking it with all their might. There was not much fear of their weapons breaking as the shell was basically made or calcium carbonate, against which their swords were resistant.

The men kept on attacking it, but in its attempt to protect its exposed skin, it was curbed to retaliate. After receiving a few heavy blows, the creature, in massive ire, spun around rapidly. It started coiling its body and finally stood like a wheel. With its great portentous form, it seemed that it was ready to crush anything which came in its way. "Now, what is that?", Norton said slowly. The creature started rolling around in the spherical burrow, just like a wheel in full accelerating, without dropping to the ground. It posed a great threat to the men in the burrow. Everyone was frantically trying to dodge it and trying to save themselves.

"We have pushed ourselves into a very difficult situation. It is now the question of life and death", the king shouted. Norton, being plucky, tried to follow the movement of the creature. When he had analysed it and gathered some idea, he posed in a way ready to strike. As soon as the creature passed from in front of it, he jumped and dabbled his sword into the creature. The sword went inside the grooves of the creature's coil and got stuck there. The sword moved rapidly with the circular motion of the creature, taking Norton with itself, whose grip loosened and he was flung across the burrow onto a wall. He became injured seriously.

On the other hand, the creature, it its coil form, fell down flat to the ground. Atix ran and came onto the creature. He struck his sword right into the center most part of the coil. The sword went inside and impaled the exposed skin of the creature with great force. Blood rushed out of the grooves of the coil, milky white in colour. "Eww! Looks gross!", Atix exclaimed. Suddenly, the creature released its coil form, throwing off Atix. It jerked up and then fell down to the ground, dead, blood still oozing of of its wound.
