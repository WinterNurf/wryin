# Reunion

"At last, it is dead", Jake said. The king replied, "Phew! Oh boy! I am tired. Same with you people also, huh?". "Yeah, same here, but I am injured a little too", said Atix in a querulous tone. Jake replied, "Yeah! That is what happens when you show too much of bravery-". The king, in a serious tone, interrupted, "Cut out you jokes. Look at Norton, he is in such a serious condition. We got to help him". "Yes, and figure out a way to get out of this burrow", Atix added. The king ordered, "Jake, you go and find a way to get out of here. Atix, you and I shall tend to Norton". "Yes, Your Majesty", Atix and Jake replied in chorus.

Jake went on to the tunnel from where they had come. At first, it was easy to climb on, but when the tunnel became vertical, climbing up became very difficult. However, Jake managed with the help of the many grooves in the walls of the burrow. Finally, he was at the top, Altair eagerly looking at him. "Where are the others?", Altair asked in a mysterious deep tone and a smirk on his face. Jake replied, "I was just finding a way to come up. The creature is dead. Norton is injured so His Majesty and Atix are tending to him. I think we will need your help to heal Norton up".

The smirk on Altair's face wore off as soon as Jake told him that the creature was dead and the others were safe. "Oh! Well, nice", Altair sighed. Jake said, "You sound different", and disappeared below the edge of the burrow, descending it and taking the slide down. After much efforts everyone came up and managed to bring Norton above.

On the other side, in the city of Drien, Senister had opened up a warp, through which the team in Drein were viewing the hardships faced by the others who were in the enchanted forest. Senister had done this because there was nothing much happening in Drein and everyone wanted to see where the king and the others were. Robina, moving towards the warp and looking at it keenly said, "I see them in grave danger". Lavista, nodding her head, said, "They definitely need us". "Okay then, if so is your wish", Senister replied, and moved in front of the warp. He murmured some spell under his breath, making the warp grow bigger. "Enter", he said, going through it. Lavista and Robina could see Senister standing with the others in the woods, and talking to them. They also entered it then.

The walls of the castle disappeared behind them and the view of the woods which they saw in the warp appeared. The evening sun was setting down and the weather was cool. "Hello everyone", they said. There was a lot of greeting and laughing as they stood near the burrow. Lavista then said, "I think I should heal Norton now, and everyone else too". After the healing ceremoney, everyone was rejuvenated and walking away from the burron on the path ahead of it. The sun had set down and dark clouds had covered the dark blue curtain above them.

"Looks like there is going to be a downpour", Altair said. The king, looking at the sky, replied, "We will need to find shelter. Move quickly, and look out for some trees or structures which can provide a roof over our heads". The night was becoming darker, the weather getting chilly. Robina had taken a dislike to Altair as she had noticed that he was talking rudely to everyone. The king whispered to Norton, "Doesn't Altair seem different?". Norton replied, "Yes, he does seem different. Suddenly".

Everyone's fears came out true, and it started raining cats and dogs. "Oh no! I do not want to get wet", Robina groaned. Everyone started running. "Hmm! What a sudden surge of energy in Altair", Jake murmured, seeing Altair running at light speed. Senister's expression widened and he became excited. "Look! An oversized mushroom. This should give us a very nice shelter". Everyone dashed towards the mushroom, trying to save themselves from the rain. Everyone was easily accommodated under the giant structure. A thunderstorm began. However, everyone was feeling cosy.

Robina asked the king, "This Altair is a creepy person. So rude to everyone. Why are we taking him with us?". The king whispered and replied, "Yes, but he is not like this. I have noticed a change in his attitude just recently". "Oh! I was thinking why would you keep such a rude person with you. This is really very strange".

The thunderstorm was getting closer. Lightning was striking everywhere around. A squall started. Lavista, crouching a little, said, "I am feeling scared". Atix replied, "Do not worry. We are safe under this mushroom". Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck directly in front of them, lighting up the whole area. Looking at Altair, everyone froze.

For a split second, instead of Altair's body, a skeletal structure could be seen. "Wha... Why are you people staring at me?", said Altair, stammering. He had committed a mistake. He should not have stood so close to a sudden flash of light. The thunderstorm was also a great disadvantage to him. "Ah! No, uh... nothing", the king too stammered, suspecting Altair. Altair walked to the other side of the stem of the mushroom. This eased the others a little.

The king moved closed to Norton and quietly whispered in his ears, "Don't you think there is something wrong with Altair? He is behaving so strangely. We have to find out everything. Even if we have to turn against him". Norton replied in a serious tone, "Yes, Your Majesty. I have been noticing the same. There has been a sudden change in his attitude, his energy levels".

The intensity of the rain had decreased to a drizzle. However, the thunderstorm was still hovering above. "The storm seems to have settle down. I think we should move on", Senister said. The king, reflecting his words, ordered, "We shall move on. No storm can stop us", and started. Everyone followed him in a straight line. However, Altair refrained. He said, "Wait, let the storm settle down completely. It would be unwise to go out now. The storm could break out again". The king replied, "But the storm could even last for a day or two. We can't wait till then". Altair raised his deep, weird voice and tried to persuade the king, "Please! We have to wait", he looked desperate. The king contradicted, "Why'd you want to?". "I- I- please!". "Why this unnecessary delay?".

"You're not like Altair", said Jake, pushing Altair, making him fall to the ground. Altair got up, disted himself and shouted, "You step aside. I am not talking to you". "Shut up", saying this, Jake kicked Altair. Altair punched Jake on his face, making him go black and blue. "Stop it you both", Lavista screamed. Everybody else tried to stop their fight, but failed. Jake and Altair broke out into a full fledged fight. After a very long fight, Altair was in Jake's grip, lying on the ground, under his shoe. Jake took out his sword and raised it.

"Stop it!", Robina shouted. However, it was too late. Jake had already pushed his sword down with full force. As soon as the sword was about to touch Altair, he vanished and only a skeleton was left it his place. The sword passed between its robs, tearing the blue robes worn by it. Everyone was shocked seeing this strange development. Atix said, "Altair, you didn't tell us you were a skeleton". Jake was very serious, "You scoundrel. You can't be Altair!". The skeleton replied, "Please! Please! I- I- I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything", he was panting. "First please, let me out of this difficult situation. I am stuck here because of your sword". Jake was furious. However, the thoughts of Altair and where he would be flashed through his mind. After standing there for a few moments he took out his sword from the ground and covered it in its sheath.

The skeleton got up and the next moment Jake had grabbed its collar bone. "Where is Altair?", Jake asked, a frightening flair in his voice. "I'll tell you, I'll tell you", the skeleton was shrugging with fright. "I am a shapeshifter sent from the undead divisions. Your friend Altair was causing a lot of trouble in the Chaos tunnels, so we had to kidnap him. I was sent to take his place. The others probably would be taking him away now".
