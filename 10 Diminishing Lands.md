# Diminishing Lands

In the dark land of Lich-a-mons, Altair was being carried by a few undead zombies in a very compact cage. The erratic walking style of the zombies made it very uncomfortable for Altair. Every time the undead took a step, Altair felt a jerk. He was being carried on a very dark path, yet everything was visible, though dull and blurred. It was a deal place. There was no grass, no bushes, no plants. No creature in vision. It was just black, barren land, with only dead trees all over.

"Let me out of here", Altair shouted, shaking vigorously, irritated by the intolerable head and peculiar, life sucking stench. The movement made one of the undead fall down. It got up, caught Altair's neck and said in a deep, dead voice, "Shut up. Let us do our duty". It kept its open palm on Altair's chest and absorbed some tendrils out of Altair, who fell unconscious. A lot of time had passed when Altair regained consciousness. He looked outside his cage. Ahead of him lied a might river flowing with red hot lava. The heat inside the cage increased tremendously. Facing the river stood a huge castle like structure. Altair tried to figure out what it was, but the intense heat made his head ache.

"Oh! God. This is even worse than a migraine.". The undeads were murmuring, "Ah! At last, the prison has arrived. End of it now". Altair again shook vigorously, and once again was made unconscious by an undead. He was in a dreamy state. He dreamt of the king, the captured queen and prince. He dreamt of Jake and the others. He dreamt of coming back to Drein and living there happily. Suddenly, everything vanished. He was covered completely by darkness. He felt his life source departing. He felt nothing then, everything was empty.

Slowly, his eyes opened. He regained consciousness. "Oh! What a dream. Frightening", he though. "Oh! At last. He is awakening. Are you find?", said a soft, girly voice. Altair looked up and saw a youn lady, full clad in plain light blue robes, standing in front of him. He then  looked where he was. He was in a prison cell, with four others, excluding the girl. It was surrounded by three walls, and one side was covered with bars. He frantically stood up, and looked out of the bars. All he could see was a long, dark corridor lined with torches on the front wall, which had a very mild flame.

"Gosh! Where am I?", Altair interrogated, however not addressing anyone. He was grabbing the cell bars tightly. "We are in the prison of the Moss fortress", said a man who had a very fair complexion and was wearing green, archer robes. His ears were long and pointed. He was an elf! "Yes, this is the undead prison. Anyone who goes against the undead ends up here", these words were said by a dwarf, who is needless to say, a very short man. A goblin, which is a green, ugly creature, added, "This cell is for creatures foreign to the undead". Another creature, a small sized troll was sitting in one corner. "Ah! You are welcome here", he said with a sigh.

Altair dropped to his knees, "Haven't you all ever tried to break out from here?". The girl said, "Of course we have tried, many times. But we have always failed". There was a sense of dissatisfaction in her tone. Suddenly, everyone became quiet. A guard passed from in front of them, through the corridor. It wasn't an undead. It was a human, probably under the control of the undead.

Altair, leaning over to look at the guard, said, "Bad luck for that human. Anyways, what all have you tried to escape from here? Tell me everything". "We have tried many things", the elf started telling, "This whole cell is fool proof. We cannot escape from here. But-", the elf stopped as the guard passed by again. When the guard was quite far away, he resumed, "But, they give us time, about three hours, when they take us out to work. And also while getting the meals. I will give you the rest of the information outside. There are just a few minutes left for the working time".

The next few minutes were spent in silence. The guard passed from the corridor a number of times. DHUM - cam a loud sound. The guard came running to their cell and opened up the lock. Altair was closely observing everything. "Come on, quick. You have to assemble near the mining area". Everyone came out. The guard then moved over to other cells. Everyone headed to the mining area. Altair was observing the building structure and design very keenly. After a few twists and turns, they were out of the man building of the castle. Many pits were dug up there.

"Oh! To work now", the troll gloomily said. Everyone grabbed their pickaxes and got to work on the same pit. The place was covered with undead. However, they all looked thoroughly civilised and friendly. The place was also full of pits. Behind them was the main castle building. Ahead lied a great wall, so massive that nothing was visible after it. The whole place was uncomfortable dark and gloomy. The dwarf said, "Now, let me tell you what all we tried to escape from here. Everday we are taken here to work. We have tried to go to the other side of the castle and climb the main gate from there. That task seems to be impossible. A number of times we were caught by the guards. Only one time we succeeded, but climbing that wall is very difficult. We cannot accomplish that". Altair nodded.

The dwarf resumed, "As for this wall, it is easy to reach till there but then it would be very difficult to climb it. Though we haven't climbed it, this wall looks tricky. The main danger here is that it is an open area. We will be very easily spotted if we try to scale this wall". Altair was listening very carefully, and at the same time, observing the surroundings.

They all worked very hard for they day, mining a turquoise coloured glowing substance. It looked very bright in the dark surroundings. Everyone now was back in the cell, panting and sweating. Everyone in the cell lied down to rest while Altair sat down in the iddle of the cell, cross legged, thinking. The whole cell was in silence. It looked like night time. However, in this land, there was no distinction between day and night. It was always night time here.

"I have an idea", Altair said, breaking the silence. After a few hours, when even Altair was asleep, a loud sound came. DHUM! Everyone woke up with a start. "What? Work time again?", Altair sleepily asked. The goblin replied in the same tone, "No, it is meal time. I hate this part the most. First they make us work so hard and then disturb our sleep". The guard came again and opened up the cell, "Go for your meals, fast", he yelled, and then headed on. This time, they were taken to a great hall, full of undead. There weren't any chairs or tables there. Everyone was sitting on the floor.

Altair wasn't thinking about what kind of food he would get. He was busy observing the building and making plans to escape. A set of human guards were serving stale bread and some salad. Everyone ate hurriedly and then were locked up again in their cell. "I'll go hungry from next time but won't eat that rotten food", Altair said with distain. The girl said, "Do not worry about that. When you will start starving, you'll eat all that readily". Altair replied, "That condition won't come. We will escape from here before that".

He told everyone of his plans. Finally, when they were in the mining area again, it was time to execute them. Everyone was toiling hard, mining the blue substance. The girl came closer to Altair and whispered in his ears, "Plan in action". Altair showed a thumbs up to the rest of the team. Everyone except the girl and Altair went near the wall and started digging a fresh pit. "Hey! You all. Do not dig there. Mine from the existing pits", a guard barked out at them. The cheeky elf replied, "O, kind sir. The reserves of the existing pits have depleted. We thought we would dig here to provide a better output". "Oh! Very well. Continue", the guard agreed. "Wow! That was good. I'll work my best today. I'll do anything to get out of here", the goblin blurted. "Get to work now. And do not bring the words of escaping from here on your mouth. We have to be careful of eavesdropping".

On the other side, the girl and Altair joined a few undead people who were mining in a nearby pit. "Try to start a conversation. Maybe we will be able to know what this substance is", Altair whispered to the girl. For a few moments, they just mined without talking. Slowly they started conversing. By the time they all had returned to the cell, they had gathered quite some knowledge. Altair shared the information with everyone, "I came to know that the blue substance we mine is the energy source of a demon, who is a key weapon of the undead. The more it gets this substance, the more powerful it becomes. Day by day it is gaining strength. From now on, mine the least of that blue substance. We will also have to spread this advice to the other undead people mining. What about the pit?". The dwarf replied, "We have had good progress. It'll be ready in about three days. I don't think the wall will go too deep".

They next day, again, they continued to dig. The dwarf jumped into the pit to dig further and investigate the progress. At that very moment, a guard came up to them and asked, "Where is that little guy who was working with you?". Everyone became tense. However, the troll handled the situation by replying, "Oh! He was feeling thirsty so he has just gone to get some water". The guard seemed to be satisfied and went his way. After some time, the dwarf came out of the pit with glee. He announced, "Good news, guys. This wall does not go very deep. Just a little way to go. We will surely make it by tomorrow".

A very long time had passed when finally it was time. It was time to escape. The goblin came up to Altair who was conversing with some undead people and whispered, "The tunnel is ready. It's time". Everyone was now assembled near the finished tunnel entrance. "Ah! I am feeling so happy. At last", saying this, Altair jumped into the tunnel. He was followed by the others, and at last the troll. The circumference of the tunnel was a little small for the troll's fat tummy. He got stuck in it. To go down, he started struggling. A guard heard the noise he was making but luckily the troll managed to slide down before the guard reached.

On the other side of the wall, everyone came out one by one. On this side, the troll managed easily. "Oh! Oh! Tough luck for us", the goblin mumbled. This he said because they were now standing at a place with a wall behind them, under which they had come from, and another wall in front of them, which was made of shabbily arranged big blocks of stone. Altair said with determination, "The undead have left no flaws in security. But we have to time to waste. We have to scale this wall as soon as we can".

As soon as they all had reached the stone wall in front of them, the prison guards started appearing from the hole which they had come from. "Go! Go! Go!", shouted Altair. They all started climbing the wall. "Fast, come on everyone. The guards are fast behind us", Altair warned. Suddenly, an arrow came flying from the guards and struck the goblin in its leg. "Aah!", he lout out a shriek. It lost grip, slipped from the wall and fell down on the ground below. Everyone stopped to look down below. A number of shrieking voices of the goblin came from beneath then. Then finally when a sword had pierced through his body and he lay down dead, voices of the guards rejoicing could be heard.

The elf shouted, "Nooooooo!". Altair said, "We have no time now. We cannot save him. The best we can do in this situation here is flee as soon as possible". In no time, they were on the other side of the wall. This side was very hot. There was a path in front with lava flowing on either side. The land was black. Huge watch towers stood beside the path on both sides, six in number. The descend was easier and faster than the ascend. On the other side, the guards had started climbing the wall.

When Altair and the others were down from the other side of the wall, the girl said, "Look at those watch towers. According to my analysis of the position of the windows and all, I believe we aren't visible form here. However, if we go about a dozen yards from here, we'll be right in vision". Altair called everyone closer to him and started explaining, "Now, the plan is, I will try and sneak up to the towers and try to slay the people stationed there. Till that time, you people try to keep the guards off the wall". The troll banged his fist on his chest, "I'll keep them away". Saying this, he started banging the wall with his soulders. The guards who were climbing on the other side of the wall started falling down due to the great impact of the vibrations caused.

The girl asked Altair, "Won't you be noticed? There are so many watch towers here". He replied, with a smirk on his face, "I know what to do". Saying this, he started running forward on the path. After ascending six to seven yards, he jumped down from the path into the pool of lava. "Nooooo, Altair!", the girl shouted with fear. "I'm fine here", came Altair's voice, who was hanging from the path. His feet were hanging just a foot above the lave. In this position, he moved forward to the first watch tower. He somehow managed to cling to the path the whole way. Altair saw some slits in the wall sof the watch tower, which he used to climb up to the wall. He was climbing from the side which was facing the lava. One slip and he was dead.

However, the advantage of climbing from this side was that he was not visible to the other watch tower. Also, he wasn't visible from the watch tower he was climbng. Finally, when he reached the top, he saw a window like rectangular piece cut out. He jumped inside from it and stealthily hid behind the ghouls stationed there. He streteched out his hands hand pointed his palms towards both the ghouls. Nothing happened.

"What happened to my powers? This is strange. What to do now? Ah!", Altair took out the two keris kept in his belt and slashed the necks of the two ghouls from behind. The next moment, dead bodies of the ghouls lay down on the ground, red coloured mist emanating form them. "Typically undead".

The guards from the other watch towers noticed the red mist. All the ghouls flew to the window from where they had seen the red mist. Everyone was blinded by the mist, but Altair, regaining the ability to sense aura, came to know of the location of the ghouls. "Oh-boy!", Altair killed all the ghouls with both his keris in quick succession. Now, the red mist from that watch tower became so intense that it escaped from its window, staining the sky above.

The others who were still near the wall noticed the red mist. "I guess Altair has killed everyone at the watchtower", said the girl. "I too guess so", said the dwarf, coming closer to the girl. The troll gave one last blow to the wall and said, "Then what are we waiting for? Let's move on".

Everyone started moving on the path boldly. Altair took the front ladder of the watchtower to come down and joined the others. The elf babbled, "These undead people have a very weak security system". By now, the prison guards had crossed the wall. Altair sensed something behind him. "The guards are coming", he said coldly and paused for a while, "Run". Everyone's feel started running wild almost automatically. The lava on the sides of the path was swishing and splashing, the guards following close behind. The path narrowed so much that everyone had to cross it tip-toe, with the added danger of falling into the lava. After some time, the path widened again. The troll broke the narrow path with his fists, leaving the guards on the side of the prison.
