# Blood Vein

They continued their journey henceforth. On the other side, the king and the others had already entered Lich-a-muns. The skeletal shapeshifter was still with them. He was guiding the way to the castle of the undead king. He was tightly siezed by Norton so that he could not escape. After being threatened for quite some time by Jake, the shapeshifter had lied to them that Altair was in the king's castle. "Ah! What a plan I have made. I'll take them to the king's castle. There they will easily be overpowered by us. They all will be killed", the shapeshifter was thinking.

They could see only black, barren land in every direction. After walking for a mile or two, they could see three medium sized structures which were made of coal like rocks. They could see light coming out of the window like cut outs in the structures. Everyone stopped. The king moved closer to the skeletal shapeshifter and inquired, "What's that, mister skeleton?". The skeletal shapeshifter replied, "These are the Sendrade-3 barracks". "What is Sendrade". "Hmm! Argh, those are called sectors in your community". "Are they dangerous?". "I don't know". Atix came close and grabbed one of his rib and said, "Tell us". The skeletal shapeshifter cried, "Yes, they are". "That's better".

They all moved towards the barracks. As soon as they came closer, a few sets of armour sprang out. The pieces were not joined, with a few spaces between all the parts. The spaces were see through, which proved that they were empty. "O my God. They are empty!", Senister exclaimed. Jake said, "I think they are enchanted. Just boxes of tin. This fight is going to be very difficult". 

All the armour sets drew out their swords and posed ready to fight. Everyone broke out on them. However, Senister remained at the back doing something. Every time the armour sets fell, they reassembled themselves and stood right back, as if they had never fallen. Lavista was having a hard time healing so many people all alone. This continued for a very long time. "Fall apart everyone", Senister shouted. Everyone was startled. They looked at Senister. He locked his hands and then took them apart with a jer, as if he was throwing something. A white coloured transluscent wave travelled forward and hit each one of the armour sets. They all dropped to the ground.

"Wow! That was good. What did you do?", Robina asked. Senister replied, "Well, all I did was remove the enchantment from the armour sets. You all did a great job keeping them away until the incantation was ready though". During this conversation, the shapeshifter tried to sneak away. Luckily, Robina spotted him before he was out of sight and shot an arrow towards him. He first had thought that he would get everyone else killed, but seeing the chance, he realized that it would be best to escape. The arrow travelled quickly to the skeleton and went through his ribs, making him fall. It then glued to the ground so as to trap him.

"Wah! Using my technique, huh?", Jake said. "Well, sure", Robina replied. Everyone quickly ran up to the shapeshifter. "Well tried, you bag of bones", Norton said. The king removed the arrow and grabbed his neck. "Uh! Sorry... Pl- Please. Le- Leave me. I will take you to the castle I- I promise". He was forgiven and was again guiding the way to the castle.

Gradually, it was becoming darker and darker, though the surroundings were still visible. The amount of dead trees had increased. Moment by moment, the density of the trees increased so much that it looked like a woods. Everyone was now standing in a clearing with trees all around them.

"This place creeps me", said Atix, holding tightly onto the hilt of his sword. "Hey! Look. What's over there", said Lavista pointing towards a far away tree. They all could see some shadowy figures moving about at a distance among the trees. "Be prepared", whispered the king, taking out his sword. Atix and Jake did the same. Suddenly Norton sneezed which made everyone shiver. "Are you trying to give me a heart attack?", whispered Jake, frowning at Norton. "Sorry, but I didn't do it on purpose", replied Norton. They all noticed that the shadowy figures were moving towards them. "Oww! Slowly they are becoming bigger", said Norton, staring at the figures. "Brainless chap", thought Jake, and said, "They are not becoming big, they are coming closer".

Gruadually, the shadowy figures started becoming visible clearly. Seeing the figures, everyone put back their swords. "They are our horses", shouted Jake in joy. There were five horses moving towards them. "We had left them before near the entrances of the Chaos tunnels. Finally we have found them", said Norton. "Well I think they have found us", said the king. "Oh! Yes.. erm.. You are right.".

On seeing Jake and the others, the horses broke out into a full gallop. Jake was feeling very happy, seeing the love of the horses. However, as they came closer, he noticed black slit-like marks all over them. Their appearance had become shabby and their eyes looked ghostly. Their hair had become a little transluscent. "Take out your swords, everyone. You'll need them". Everyone was surprised hearing Jake's words, though they agreed. It was just a little while after which their queries were answered. The horses did not slow down in front of them, as everyone had expected. They kept on galloping and then attacked. However, they only targeted Norton, Jake, the king and Atix. Jake was being ambushed by two of them.

"They are undead", Norton yelled. "Yes, that is why I asked you to take out your swords", Jake replied. "Yes, but then we will need the Etho elixir to make them vulnerable to our attacks". "Yes, I know. We do not want to kill them. These swords are just to ward them off. If they get too imposing, then we will have to use the elixir". Lavista said, "This is strange. They aren't attacking half of us". Jake replied, "I got it. These horses are attacking only those who left them. I left two of them, so two are attacking me. This is our fight. We have to tame them".

The horses were getting mad. In between, they stopped fighting, but then started again, as if overwhelmed by an external force. Jake's plan was working. The swords were defending the men, without damaging the horses. Jake was in double trouble. The two horses surrounded Jake from the opposite sides. They started charging towards him. It was too late now. If Jake had used the elixir, he would have an option to kill the horses and save himself. But now, he could do nothing. His sword would be useless. The horses would ram into him and end his life. However, Jake used his grey matter. He dropped his sword to the ground and crouched. Then, as soon as the horses were very near to him, he jumped with all his might. He could only reach onto the neck of one horse. However, taking support from it, he hauled himself upwards and swung himself onto its neck. He held his ears. The horse became wild, jumping and kicking, but Jake lovingly held it and soothed it. Finally, the horse was clamed. The slits disappeared, its eyes became normal. The horse was tamed, living again.

The same changes occurred with the other horse which was attacking Jake. The others, on seeing what Jake had done, did the same, though with greater ease. Finally, all the horses were living and tamed. "Wow, finally. This whole fight was so frightening", Robina said. "I'm feeling so happy, seeing these horses once again!", Norton exclaimed. "Now, you skeleton, come here. Show us the way to Altair", Jake said. The shapeshifter replied, "Yes, yes. I'll take you to Blood Vein. Oh yes, by the way, Blood Vein is the name of the castle". Everyone rode doubles except for a few and made their way to Blood Vein.

Meanwhile, Altair and the others had sneaked up to the main entrance of the Moss fortress. The main gate opened. A huge troll appeared from behind the wall, pulling a cart loaded with the shiny turquoise coloured substance. "Here it comes. Come on, get into it", Altair whispered to the others. Everyone jumped into the cart. They got completely covered by the blue substance and so their vision was completely blocked. The blue substance felt hard on them. It was slimy, like it was covered with some kind of oil, and was cold to touch.

The cart was moving steadily. Everyone was receiving rhythmic bumps. Every few minutes, the surrounings became very hot. "Maybe we are surrounded by lava now", the elf thought. It was a very uncomfortable position in which everyone travelled. After some time, the cart stopped. Suddenly, everyone felt being dragged outside. They topped over and quite a few rocks fell over them. They could hear the creaking of the wheels of the cart fading away. Finally when there was no sound to be heard, everyone tried to get up.

"Ah! The rocks are too heavy. We cannot get out of here", the troll irritably said. Altair replied, "Do not worry, you can leave that to me". Saying this, he blew up the whole pile of the blue substance with his supernatural powers.

On the other side, the king and the others were riding on their horses, trying to reach Blood Vein as soon as possible. Jake was riding with the shapeshifter to ensure that he did not escape. He was holding a bottle of Etho elixir in one of his hand. However, even if the skeleton would have to ride alone, he could not go anywhere as the horses were very loyal.

Suddenly, Lavista noticed a very thin stream of blood flowing on the ground. She made everyone aware of it, and then they all started looking for its cause. The stream was hardly noticeable, just two to three centimetres wide. During this time, the shapeshifter had tried to jump away from the horse, but had failed because Jake had held him tightly. After going further, they could now see two streams wide apart from each other. One was that which they had been following, the other was similar. The only difference was that something green in colour was flowing in it. Going even further, a grey coloured stream came into view. Maybe there would have been a black one too, but it would never have been visible due to the black colour of the ground.

Suddenly, a swarm of bats flew past them. It was followed by another, and then another. The size of the bats was increasing progressively. They sky had a red glow around it, covered with a black haze. The bats did not come for a while. After some time, huge bat like fugures, but a little different, could be seen in the sky. "Trouble's soming our way, I suppose", Norton said. The horses and the bat like figures, both were moving with immense speed. In no time, the creatures were hovering over the horses. "Intimidating", the king said. They were gargoyles. One fo the gargoyle came closer to Jake, but he shook it off by swinging his arm. "Shoo! Go away you devils". The gargoyles made screechy noises, showing their yellow, pointed teeth.

In fright, Robina shot an arrow towards the gargoyle which had tried to attack Jake. It travelled quickly, puncturing the wing of the gargoyle. It dropped to the ground near Jake. It was trampled over by his horse. Seeing this, the other gargoyles started screeching louder, while the gargoyle on the ground fell down, dead.

The gargoyles organised themselves into a circle high above the ground. "What are they doing now? Looks scary, as if warning us about great trouble", Atix said. The gargoyles then started coming down one by one. However, it seemed that they followed proper war rules. The gargoyles attacked only each of the horses, the others remained high up in the air. A wild battle followed. Everyone fought while riding on their horses. The shapeshifter was having a lot of trouble trying to balance himself on the horse and also dodge the vicious gargoyles. As soon as one gargoyle had been killed, another one came in its place.

Wings were being slashed off, dead bodies were being trampled over. The horses were also receiving heavy blows. The gargoyle which was attacking Lavista's and Robina's horse gave a heavy blow on to the backside of the horse, inflinting a surge of fear in him. The horse started running around wildly. The gargoyle followed close behind. The gargoyle, on becoming irritated, started flying faster. It went under the horse and then, picking him up, started flying high. The horse was left baffled. It started moving its legs, but did not move as he was supported by his belly.

"We have to do something or we will fall down from here", Lavista shouted. Robina said, "We can take some advantage of the situation". She started shooting the gargoyles which were up in the air. When all of them had dropped, she said, "Lavista, kill this gargoyle". "No, but we'll fall". "Just do it". Lavista took out her dagger and impaled it into the gargoyle. It started falling towards the ground. "Now, what should we do, huh?", Lavista asked in anger. "Just wait and watch", Robina replied.

While falling, the gargoyle left the horse. The horse was now in free fall. "Concentrate all your healing powers onto the legs of the horse, come on fast", Robina shouted. As soon as the horse was going to touch the ground, Robina kicked hard. The horse instantly started running wildly. Everyone felt a heavy jerk, but Lavista's healing powers did not let the horse's legs from getting injury. "That was scary", Lavista said.

Finally, all the gargoyles had been killed. Robina had contributed a lot in killing the gargoyles who were all stationed high above in the air in the circle formation. Everyone was very frightened after experiencing the thrill of the fight. Their hearts were beating loudly. "It was damn scary", Norton said. Everyone exchanged their feelings and experiences. Later, they mounter their horses and continued their journey towards Blood Vein.

The streams of the different strange liquids were still flowing, getting even more emphasised. "Aah! It seems all of my bones have broken", the shapeshifter said, holding his left arm bones. Jake taunted, "Well, I see them alright". After a long pause, Jake questioned, "What are the little colourful streams that are flowing here on the ground, huh?". The shapeshifter explained, "Oh! Don't ask, you will become sick. Ah... Okay, I'll tell you, I'll tell you. These... These streams are b... blood, yes, blood. They are of people who have been slaughtered in Blood Vein. These streams flow from the very top of the castle to all sides of it. They flow until they disappear into the soil. Oh! Yes, the castle has an unlimited supply of the blood. These are just a little part of that. Y- You won't even imagine what br- brutal things are d- done with the rest. You even find pools of b- blood inside t- the castle". In this speech, the shapeshifter was trying to scare Jake a little, however, Jake didn't mind the least.

After riding for a while, everyone could see a dappled patch of land with a sign board dug into it. It had a castle shaped insignia made on it, with five skulls made below it. The shapeshifter murmured, "Alas, just five skulls to Blood Vein". "What is five skulls?", the king inquired. "Oh! The are just measuring units". "So how much would it be?". "Well, it would take us about fifteen minutes to reach the castle, and that too if we move with a speed faster than now". After riding for a short while, a roof like structure came into view. Slowly, the view widened and the castle started appearing from below the land. At its main entrance, there were numerous undead guards walking to and fro.

"I think we should get down from the horses now. We can fetch them when we get back", Jake affirmed. Everyone agreed. "How will we get past these guards?", asked Norton, holding his head. "We have got a key to it", Atix replied, directioning his eyes towards the shapeshifter. The shapeshifter easily understood what Atix meant and said, "Oh! Well. I'll get you through. Follow me".

Suddenly, skin started appearing on the shapeshifter. He transformed into a human-like form, but with red coloured skin, which had two horns projecting out of his head. "Ah! This is nice. Now I am the head security guard of this castle. So let's go", he said. Everyone followed the shapeshifter towards the castle. The guards stood aside in attention and let everyone pass. "Wow. That was good, but don't think you could fool us, or you would be in great trouble", Senister warned. Everyone was now in a black coloured tunnel like corridor. The ceiling was glowing red with heat. They kept on moving forward. The direction of the path turned to the left, which everyone followed. As they moved on, trouble was approaching at the entrance.
