# Battles Against the Dark

The trouble was the real head security guard. Yes, the real one had approached the main entrance of the castle. The guards were staring at him, baffled. "Why are you staring at me like bumbies?", the head security guard asked. The guards came back to their senses and quickly maded crosses with their spears, blocking the entrance. "What is this nonsense? Don't make me feel humiliated". A small guard blurted, "You just entered the castle. You cannot enter again". The big guard beside him murmured, "He means a man like you, the real head security guard". "What? Did you ask him the secret code?". "Oh! No, sir. There were many people with him, and I thought it would not be nice. After all, I knew you quite well". "It mush have been somone in disguise. You idiots, sound the sirens, quickly. Put the whole castle on high alert".

On the other side, everyone became alert on hearing the siren. "What is this?", the king asked. The shapeshifter frantically replied, "Trouble. I think the guards have come to know that we tricked them and entered. Run, hide. Go wherever you want. Don't let the guards catch you". Though the shapeshifter was actually tricking Jake and the others, illegally entering the castle was a punishable offence in the undead land, whatever the reason might be. The shapeshifter transformed back to its original form and started running. The others started following him. The tunnel soon ended and a maze of corridors started to appear.

The shapeshifter, in haste, just took any door and any path. At last, everyone reached a dome shaped chamber which had numerous pillars in it. "Quick, hide", the shapeshifter hurriedly said, painting. Norton commented, "I don't know how he pants. He has nothing but bones". "Keep quiet!", shouted Jake. "Where can we hide?". Be now, Senister had noticed that the pillars had decoration, exactly like themselves, attached to their sides but a little cut off from the top so that they did not touch the roof, and hollow from the inside. The cut off spaces were almost equal to a qarter length of the roof. The decorations were wide enough to accommodate a normal person inside them. "We can hide in these", saying this, he told everyone about his plan.

Everyone nodded in agreement and each headed inside different decorations. They provided enough grooves to let everyone climb up to them easily. Everyone was hidden completely concealed in them. After some time, they could hear whispering voices and footsteps coming from from outside, from the chamber they were in. After a lot of hustling and noises of things being inverted etc. the guards left. "They have left", thought everyone. However, everyone wanted to be on the safe side and so they waited, but just for a little more while. After that, almost at the same time, everyone had started coming out. No one noticed what was happening in the room as everyone was busy minding themselves and getting out of their hiding places. When everyone had settled outside, the room became a storehouse of surprised eyes.

"Huh? Hey, Altair!", the king cried out. Altair said, "Jake, Your Majesty, Senister, Robina, Lavista, Atix, Norton", however, his smile fell on seeing the shapeshifter. "An you, you, I will kill you, you moron", he mumbled. "Stop", Jake yelled, coming in front of the shapeshifter. "He only has helped us get to the castle so that we could come and rescue you". Altair became shocked, "What? He is a traitor. Do not leave him". Altair told everyone his whole story, how he had been taken to the prison and how he had escaped from there. "Yes, I do agree that the skeleton has done wrong, but he deserves to be forgiven. He helped us in the castle, to get in, and unknowingly, he helped us reach you".

Footsteps could be heard again at a distance and everyone quickly returned to their hiding places. The sound of the footsteps came very near to them and then stopped. It did not come for a long time then. "Hmm! Maybe the guards left", Altair thought and peeked out, above the decoration piece. He quickly pulled back himself. He had seen two guards standing outside, looking around aimlessly. "Do not come out, anyone. The guards are standing outside, two of them", Altair communicated to everyone, using telepathy. The troll, neglecting his instructions, quickly came out of his hiding place, which was a hole behind a huge curtain. He came running and grabbed the guards from their neck with his hands. He picked them up util their feet were airborne quite a distance above the ground, and banged their heads. He then loosened his grip and just left them. They fell to the ground, blood coming out of their heads, no sign of life in them.

Everyone came out to see what had happened, and then praised the troll. In this conversation, Altair introduced his new friends which he made in the prison to everyone else. "Now, this is, oh-oh, I haven't bothered to ask their names, Let them introduce themselves". They all started saying their names in succession. "Uh, I am Murphy, a troll". "I am Ronald, the dwarf". "I am Brekka, one of the finest archers of the elven land". Robina's eyes were stuck at the elf after hearing this. "Hmm! Elves are very fine archers. Maybe I can learn something from him", she thought. Finally, the girl spoke out, "I am Crysteria". The king said, "Oh! Well lady. Aren't you the daughter of the king of Ettseteria?". Crysteria replied, "Oh! Yes I am". "Hmm. Princess, huh?", Altair mumbled. A faint smile appeared on Crysteria's face.

Altair then introduced his old friends to his new friends. Suddenly, a guard came into the room and staring at everyone, shouted, "Intruders". Altair quickly teleported in front of him and stabbed him with his keris. "Whoa! Already smeared it with Etho elixir, huh?", Jake asked. Altair replied, "Uh, no. I do not need it with this keris. It is made out of sabertooth teeth". Suddenly, the guard let out a big cry before falling to the ground. "This cry would probably have made the other guards alert. We should move away from here", Robina said. Everyone agreed to this statement.

Leaving the three guards in the chamber as it is, red mist emanating from their bodies, they ran out of the chamber. "We have to escape from here or the guards won't leave us. I'll show you the way", the shapeshifter told, who seemed to have turned traitor to the undead. "Are you sure we will directly be able to run out from here?", Atix asked. The king budged into the conversation, "We have to save the queen and the prince. I believe that the undead king resides in this palace, and that they are in his hold. Take us there first". The shapeshifter replied, "Oh! Yes, surely. I know where they are, in the prison. I will take you there right away". 

Everyone started walking towards the prison, lead by the shapeshifter. After crossing a few corridors and many passages, they reached a passage which was intersected by another passage in which they were received a dead end at the end of the other passage. It was here that everyone stopped, and indeed, froze. They held their breathes as danger walked from in front of them. The head security guard had passed from the path in front of them, followed by four undead Aquentises. He had appeared from the right, and had slowly disappeared to teh left. For a while, everyone thought that they were safe. However, the danger was lurking behind the walls, ready to pounce. 

"Ooh! The creature which passed from in front was just like what the shapeshifter had become", Norton said. Jake replied, "Yes, I am dead sure it was the read head security guard". This conversation was quick, after which everyone started moving towards the path in front. The shapeshifter was still leading. As soon as he had reached the end of the path, he bumped into the head security guard. He started backing away, while the head security guard started walking towards him. After a while, the shapeshifter froze. The head security guard looked at everyone and then started staring sternly at the shapeshifter.

The shapeshifter, chainging colours like a chameleon, started pleading, "Oh sir! Kind sir, please save me. These people are threatening and torturing me. They are trying to take out all our information from me. Oh kind sir, please save me". The shapeshifter had fallen to his knees. "You liar, you were helping us. You helped us sneak into this palace. Do not keep changing sides", Senister shouted. The shapeshifter continued his pleading, "Look, kind sir, how these people accuse me. Believe me, I am one of you. They are imposters. Please help, save me from them". The head security guard of course believed teh shapeshifter. He yelloed, "You all, imposters. Guards, arrest them. Put them in prison". Saying this, he settled to talk with the shapeshifter.

"Altair, you can use your powers. Get ready to fight", Robina cried. However, Lavista held her back. Robina was surprised to see everyone in low spirits. Altair said calmly, "No, now is not the time". Everyone surrendered themselves to the head security guard, feeling hatred towards the shapeshifter. They all were sent to the prison.

"Get in", said the guard in a deep oice, opening the lock up. Even though everyone was walking inside the cell themselves, the guard pushed them from behind. The might of the Aquentis made them topple over each other and fall right into the cell. The Aquentis immediately locked the cell. Lavista cursed the Aquentis while getting in. As soon as the Aquentis had departed, Robina spoke up, "Why did we surrender? Why didn't we fight those hideous creatuers? Oh! Come on you all. We could have easily overpowered them. Now we are locked up in this stupid prison". Altair cleared all her doubts, "Try to understand Robina. If I would have used my powers then, and we all would have fought all those undead, the shapeshifter would no longer have remained, there were less chances of him surviving. Now, they have themselves taken us to where we were going, peacefully. Now we will easily find the queen and the prince". Though Robina's tone was full of ire, Altair's calm deep voice made her sober. She saw the sense in his words.

The king then came forward and said, "Now we will have to break in all the cells and find them". Suddenly, sobbing voices could be heard coming from the back of the cell. Everyone became quiet. The sobbing could be heard more clearly now, louder. "Who is it there", Brekka asked. Everyone looked behind. There sat a woman who had kept her head between her knees and was sobbing. A child lay beside her, who had kept his head on the woman's shoulder. He was also sobbing loudly. "What happened to you there, young lady?", the king asked. Both the child and the lady looked up. On seeing their faces, Jake, Atix, Norton, Lavista, Robina, Altair and Senister quickly bowed down. On seeing them, the others also acquired the same positon. The king's eyes got filled with tears of love. He dropped to his knees. He caught hold of the lady's hands. "Oh my dear queen".

After conversing for a long time and after meeting everybody, it was time to leave the cell. This was no big deal. However, before leaving, everyone tried to console the queen. After some time, her queenly traits had returned. "Now, I will take care of getting out of here", Altair said. The troll, while running, announced, "Ah! I can easily take care of it", and banged the prison bars to break them. He did this a number of times, but with no success. "Let me try", said Altair, and let out a blast of energy. They next  moment, the bars had turned to ashes. They easily collapsed. "Wow, you are good", the troll commented. "Yes, now we have succeeded in our mission. Now we shall return", the king commanded. Jake addressed him, "Your Majesty, we have forgotten our real mission. Now that we have come here, we will vanquish the undead. Also remember the blue substance Altair had found. We have a lot of things to do here".

Everyone agreed. With such a big team, they could risk getting caught, even a number of times. Norton suggested, "I think we should open up all the cells, but on one condition that they will help us in battling the undead. Then we will also get some help, and they will also be happy". "That is a very good idea", Atix replied. Everyone started breaking the cells, freeing the prisoners and gathering support. The clanking noises created while the cells were being destroyed made the head security guard come to the spot where the cells were situated.

"Huh! Trying to escape and freeing all the criminals? Try that next time", the head security guard said, strictly. "Next time won't come", Jake replied. The head security guard took out two swords and rushed towards Jake. By that time all the criminals had been freed. As soon as the head security guard had reached near Jake, an armadilo like creature whom Jake had freed came in between Jake and the head security guard, blocking the attack with its tough skin and saving Jake. The two swords of the head security guard were still stuck to the body of the armadilo like creature. While the head security guard recovered from the recoil, Jake jumped over the armadilo like creature, breaking both the swords of the head security guard with his own, and pushing him back a little.

"Guards, take them", the head security guard ordered. Four Aquentises moved forward to join the battle. Jake did not understand the sudden statement of the head security guard. He became confused and felt dizzy. Suddenly, he was pushed backwards by one of the Aquentises, ramming him into the armadilo like creature. Its tough, hard skin gave Jake a number of bruises, injuring him more that what the Aquentis had meant to do. The armadilo like creature, reading the situation, supported Jake and then jumped in front of the Aquentis to confront it. Taking the opportunity, Jake slid back.

"Fall back, everyone. Take the Etho elixir form me", Lavista cried, "Without it, you are useless". Everyone came back to take the Etho elixir. However, Altair and a few undead freed criminals kept on battling. The Etho elixir was smeared on weapon, claw and foot. Altair did a great job warding off the Aquentises from where the Etho elixir was being distributed. The head security guard was standing at the back, observing the battle. After receiving the Etho elixir everyone was ready to battle. "I hope there aren't many battles left. We're running out of Etho elixir", Lavista informed everyone.

The head security guard taunted, "Next time won't come". Jake commented, "Huh! Telling our dialogue to us". The head security guard was infuriated. He entered the battle. He had sensed that in his absence, the four Aquentises would face a hard battle, and would easily be vanquished. However, he thought that the four Aquentises and he himself would be enough for winning the battle, and so he did not call for any other help, which was his biggest mistake.

Jake alone could take all four of the Aquentises, though it would be hard for him. A harsh battle continued. The armadilo like creature had developed an instinct liking towards Jake, and kept on protecting him. However, the other freed creatures fought independently. Everyone was getting hard upon the four Aquentises, while Jake and the armadilo like creature alone took the head security guard. Jake could not beat the head security guard in strength, but of course he could in dexterity and intellect, which made him gain the upper hand. Jake's and the armadilo like creature's teamwork was stupendous. "Raaargh! You will pay for this, you stupid little creature", barked the head security guard in anger, hauling the armadilo like creature aside. The injured armadilo like creature squeaked in pain, which made Jake even more angry and filled him with the feeling of taking revenge from the head security guard. "Ah! Now I know what to do to make you more angry and irritated". Jake did not understand what the head security guard meant but he was still fighting with all his strength and wisdom of using his skills.

The head security backed off a little and created a flame like energy around himself. The head security guard shouted loudly, which made Jake close his eyes, sensing the doom, which was to come. In few seconds loud, terrifying squeaks could be heard. When Jake opened his eyes, a huge body lay on the ground - dead. The armadilo like creature was dead, lying on the ground with its broken shell on its either side.

Jake lost his dexterity and intellect in grief, but gained more strength in anger. He became bold, burning with anger. The loss of his life saviour felt hard upon him, the feeling of anger arising. His face looked ferocious. The head security guard had brought upon his own doom. Jake's body became out of control. His legs sprang up automatically. Jake closed his eyes. He felt a sudden force on his sword, his legs rested on the ground. He was breathing heavily, his eyes still closed tightly. "Yaah!", he shrieked, ripping apart his sword from the head security guard's chest. Jake slowly opened his eyes, panting, calmed down. The head security guard's body lay in front of him, still, lifeless, green coloured blood dripping from the chest, staining the red clothes which clung to it. He then looked at his sword. More than half of it was stained green, the fluid dripping drop by drop from it.

His eyes turned around. All of the Aquentises had been killed as well, he saw. Everyone left alive in the chamber was staring at him in amazement. Jake was holding to the hilt of his sword which was supporting him like a walking stick, while he was sitting. The staring continued for a wile. "Yehe! We are all free", the prince joyously said, breaking the silence. Altair lovingly explained, "A nice thought, but we are not yet free. We are captive here in this castle and the undead king still lives".

One of the freed prisoner shouted from behind, "We all together will finish all the darkness". Another undead prisoner added, "Yes, though we are undead and are considered as dirty, dark creatures, we really can be good. Our habits are different from the others, which make us dark, but yes, we have to learn to be happy within our boundaries".
