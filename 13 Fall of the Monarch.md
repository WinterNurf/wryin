# Fall of the Monarch

A prisoner called out, "I know the way to the king's quarters from here. I can take you there". The man walked out of the crowd, "I was taken there for the hearing, and after being sentenced to prison for life, I was taken here. I know the way by heart". "Now what are we waiting for? Let's move on", Atix said. "Lead the way please". The little army formed moved towards the king's chamber. They all exited the prison area, and as soon as they had reached the first curve, they saw a traitor in front of them. It was the shapeshifter, the one who had betrayed them.

The shapeshifter gazed at everyone for a long time, recovering from the shock of meeting his old, temporary unreal friends. He then quickly fell at Jake's feet, who was standing with the human prisoner guiding the way. "Oh! At last, I have found you. I was searching you for such a long time. Where have you all been?". Altair interrogated, in a querelous tone, "I guess you were there with us when we were getting locked up in the prison". The shapeshifter's expression changed to an anxious one. He started giggling and replied, "Ah-ah. W... Well, F... Forget it. We are all b-back together n... now again". Altair muttered, "Well, I don't want to see you again", and the next moment, the shapeshifter crumbled to dust.

"Ha ha, a crumbled undead", Jake laughed off. Altair smiled. Everyone was against the shapeshifter so nobody complained about his death. Everyone continued their journey, deliberately stepping on the crumbled shapeshifter. The whole castle looked gloomy, cobwebs here and there. The walls were painted dark, very less light entered inside. The castle of Drein was a magnificent  palace, Blood Vein being a dungeon. The temperature suddenly started becoming weird, niether hot nor cool. The place was becoming uneasy, step by step.

"Ah! This place is so suffocating. I hate it here", Norton painfully said. A dead silence took over. Rustling noises could be heard, coming from the end of the corridor. "What is that sound?", Atix asked. "Shhh!", the king hushed. The rustling sound grew louder as they neared the end of the corridor. The height of the ceiling was increasing gradually. A huge door stood in front of them. It was made of wood but very poorly maintained. It had scratches all over it with wood rotten here and there.

"We will have to open this door. When the guards were taking me to prison, this was already open", the human who was leading everyone told. The king asked, "Are you sure that this is the correct way?". The human leader replied, "I am dead sure". The prince went up to the door and touched the door knob. He tried to twist it, but it refused to budge. "The door is locked", the prince said in a lowly tone. "Do not worry. Altair will easily break it", the king said. Altair replied, "Yes, of course. I can" with a wry look. Altair moved out of the crowd and stood in front of the door. Everyone moved away from him. He raised his hand and murmured something under his breath. He stood there for a while. After some time, a prisoner asked, "What happened?". Altair replied, "I don't know why, but my powers are not working", the wry look on his face fading away.

Atix came forward and said, "What am I for? Let me take care of it". Saying this he retreated a little. The crowd made way for him. He started running and banged his armoured shoulder onto the door with so much force that the door broke. However it stayed there for a while and so Atix kept on pushing it. I suddenly fell down free of its hinges, making Atix fall down with it. "Ah! At least it is open now", Atix murmured. He stood up, facing everyone. They were all staring towards him. "Okay, okay, I know I have done a great thing but you do not need to be so amazed". Everyone kept on staring. "Okay, enough. Now you are embarassing me".

Everyone still kept staring. Atix was puzzled. The prince pointed behind him. Atix turned, and let out a shriek, caught by the sudden surprise of a tall creature, almost double the height of himself. It had a red coloured face with a small snout projecting out in front. Its eyes were jet black and the face was covered with scales. It had to milky white bull like horns, and spiky feathers growing out of its head and neck, arranged in a rectilinear manner. Its body seemed to have been made up of rock, brown and irregular, but still shaped as a torso. Its right arm was made of a similar type of rock, fire blazing over it. The left arm was peculiar, made up of four separate pieces, blue in colour, with the hand attached to the last piece. Both the legs were similar, made up of a black coloured rocky substance. All of its parts were not joined but separate, as if levitating in the air.

Atix quickly backed off from the creature. The dwarf, staring at the unusual creature said, "What is that?". A prisoner replied, "It is a balance elemental. Do not be afraid. Its nature is very friendly". Saying this, the prisoner started walking towards it. "Stop!", a voice from behind called out. It was an Aquentis. "Don't go near it. It's dangerous". "What are you saying? I have seen one before. It ain't dangerous", argued the prisoner. "It is dangerous! It is cursed. The balance elemental is currently under the control of the undead". The prisoner started moving backwards but it was too late. The balance elemental had noticed the crowd. The rustling noise suddenly dramatically increased. The prisoner who was backing off froze at the spot. The balance elemental shook his arm which was made up of fire. A flash of light filled the room and no one could see what had happened in that split second. However, the result was to be seen, making the beat of all hearts faster. The prisoner lay in a newly created crater, black due to burns, grey coloured steam rising up from him. Everyone was shocked and scared at this sight.

The Aquentis said, "It can attack with the power of any element. It is difficult to counter its attacks. I don't think many of us will be left". I paused for a while and then continued, "The more people fight it, the wilder it will become. This is a very calm state it is in. I think we should take it one by one, or there will be nothing else but destruction". The Aquentis then stepped forward, towards the balance elemental. "No, do not go. You won't be able to take that creature by yourself", Jake shouted. The Aquentis replied calmly, still moving forward, "There is no turning back now. Once this creature has fixed a target, it will only expand its range, not leave anyone".

The balance elemental showed no expressions. It just stood there, staring at the Aquentis. Its expressionless face proved that it was under influence, and did not react with its own mind. The Aquentis took to the air. It charged forward, but the balance elemental created a force field around it, making the Aquentis fall down in mid air. All this continued for a while. The balance elemental was defending itself, and not attacking. The balance elemental finally decided to attack. It quickly shot a conical, pointed ice like structure which came from the particles which were levitating over its crown like head. The ice piece travelled at great speed and before the Aquentis could react to thesituation after grasping the knowledge of what had happened, it punctured the abdomen of the Aquentis and passed out from its back, covered with a green coloured liquied, sprinkling all over as the ice piece passed away into the wall.

The attack was lethal, however, due to a very balanced pose of the Aquentis, it was standing as if alive. "Wow, it has survived the attack", though everyone, coming into a mood of celebration. The balance elemental now moved towards the still body of the Aquentis. Everyone was shocked on seeing the fact that the Aquentis didi not react and stood there motionless, but then their thoughts changed and they thought that it had a plan. The balance elemental lightly touched the forehead of the Aquentis with its little finger. Everyone was puzzled, but then their doubts were cleared when they saw the Aquentis fall to the ground, its lifeless, worn out face coming into everyone's view. Everyone's jaw dropped. The balance elemental stood staring at everyone.

After thinking a lot, Jake started running toward the balance elemental, with his sword drawn out. Everyone howled from behind, advising Jake not to go, but Jake wasn't listening. He had his full concentration in his forthcoming battle. During this time, the prince had noticed a door at the far end of the chamber. He went to his father and shook him a little. The king, who was engrossed in what was happening ahead, diverted his attention to the prince, whose sudden sight brought tears in his eyes. However, the prince remained completely normal and pointed out the door to him. An idea struck the king's mind. He called out, "Jake, please listen. You keep that creature busy, I will take everyone out of this place to the door there. We have to keep advancing". Jake replied, "Yes, good plan. Even if you lose me, everyone else will be safe".

He had said this with such a straight face that the king was reminded of Jake's dedication to him and how he coud not afford to lose him. However, he made him accept the fact that nothing would happen to Jake and then started transporting everyone to the next door. Jake was keeping the balance elemental at the centre while everyone slid taking support from the walls of the circular chamber. The wooden door at the end was open and everyone easily went through it. Meanwhile, Jake was having a hard time. Whenever he attacked with his sword, the balance elemental put its rocky arm in the way. The sword had no effect on that hard substance. Also, Jake's height, which was almost half as that of the balance elemental, gave him a lower hand.

The balance elemental was not being too soft on Jake, as it was with the Aquentis. The creature was attacking with all its might, using all its elements. Jake mostly kept on dodging. "If this continues, I will soon be overcome by fatigue. I have to convert my weaknesses to my strengths". There was an instance in which the balance elemental was at one end, and Jake at the other. "Everything at risk now", Jake thought. He started charging towards the balance elemental.

Jake's main fear was now the balance elemental's reaction. If it would try to attack him, then it would be difficult for Jake to survive. Jake was hoping that the creature would block his attack with its huge, rocky arm. However, its reaction was completely unexpected. It stood upright and raised its arms sideways, hoping to crush Jake between them. However, seeing the balance elemental's portentous form, Jake got confused and panicked. He droppped down to his knees and slid towards the balance elemental. His knees burned but he did not care about them. His heart beat suddenly increased. Blackness covered all over as he closed his eyes, preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. His hands automatically reeled backwards, and with the help of his speed and muscle strength, he slashed the sword onto the creature with all his might.

The sword banged and dropped from his hands. Jake slid away from under the balance elemental's legs. He stopped and looked back. He saw a diamond, blood  red, even darker in colour, fallign down.It dropped to the ground and wobbled for a while. When it came to rest, the red colour slowly started disappearing, being replaced by the typical diamond colour.

On the other side, the prisoner who was leading them said, "We have almost reached the king's chamber. He lies just beyond that door". He was pointing towards a door at the end of the corridor they were in. The door was jet black in colour, bordered by a red material. The colours were meant to remind everyone of death and bloodshed. As they reached the door, a huge grey dog jumped onto Atix. Atix, as if by a reflex action, took out his sword and pointed it towards the airborne dog. The dog was instantly killed. All this happened in a split second and was so quick that it seemed funny, however, in a dark manner. Nobody commented on the sudden attack.

"Now, who goes in first?", asked the prisoner who was leading. Everyone cowardly stook back. "Should I go?", the prince asked. A smile appeared on the king's and queen's face. The king said, "No, there is no need. I am the king here, I'll go in first". The king moved towards the black door. he stood staring there for a while, and then gave the door a light push. The door creaked open along with weird noises. There was a huge chamber in front. The chamber was very gloomy and dingy, jet black in colour with four pillars, red coloured. There was a huge chari made up of rock directly in front. The chair had many projections coming out of it which made varied designs high above it. The king of the undead, Lichendrone, sat on it. On either side of the king stood tall undead creatures, probably his bodyguards. On the adjeacent edges of the walls onto which the king's chair was supported sat many different types of undead creatures on smaller chairs, probably the ministers and of the highest order of the undead.
